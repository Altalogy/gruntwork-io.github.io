== Intro

This is a comprehensive guide of how to design, configure, and implement a Continuous Integration and Continuous
Delivery pipeline for your infrastructure code. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a secure CI/CD
pipeline using your favorite CI/CD platform (e.g Jenkins, Circle, GitLab, etc).

=== What is Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery?

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (also widely known as CI/CD) are software development practices that
involve developers merging their work together and deploying it to production on a regular basis (oftentimes as
frequent as multiple times per day). The goal of a Continuous Integration process is to integrate the features developed
independently by engineers often enough such that you can identify problems with the design earlier in the process,
allowing you to improve the design incrementally. Similarly, by deploying the software more frequently to production,
the Continuous Delivery process enables you to keep software packages small enough to reduce the risk and impact of each
deployment.

While CI/CD for application code is well understood in the software industry, CI/CD for infrastructure code is a
nascent practice. This guide focuses on providing an overview of the background info, design, and implementation
of a production-ready CI/CD pipeline for infrastructure code.


=== What you'll learn in this guide

This guide consists of four main sections:

<<core_concepts>>::
  An overview of the core concepts you need to understand what a typical CI/CD pipeline entails for infrastructure code,
  including a comparison with CI/CD for application code, a sample workflow, infrastructure to support CI/CD, and threat
  models to consider to protect your infrastructure.

<<production_grade_design>>::
  An overview of how to configure a secure, scalable, and robust CI/CD workflow that you can rely on for your
  production application and infrastructure code. To get a sense of what production-grade means, check out
  link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library#production_grade_infra_checklist[The production-grade infrastructure checklist].

<<deployment_walkthrough>>::
  A step-by-step guide to deploying a production-grade CI/CD pipeline in AWS using code from the Gruntwork
  Infrastructure as Code Library.

<<next_steps>>::
  What to do once you've got your CI/CD pipeline set up.


=== What this guide will not cover

CI/CD for infrastructure code is a large topic and a single guide cannot cover everything there is to the topic. As
such there are several items that this guide will not cover, including:

A pipeline for setting up new environments::
  This guide will focus on a CI/CD workflow for making changes to infrastructure in an environment that is already set
  up. In other words, the design and implementation of the pipeline covered in this guide intentionally does not solve
  the use case of infrastructure code for setting up an environment from scratch. Setting up new environments typically
  require complex deployment orders and permissions modeling that complicate the task. This makes it hard to automate in
  a reasonable fashion that still respects the threat model we cover here.

Automated testing and feature toggling strategies for infrastructure code::
  An important factor of CI/CD pipelines is the existence of automated testing and feature toggles. Automated tests give
  you confidence in the code before it is deployed to production. Similarly, feature toggles allow you to partially
  integrate and deploy code for a feature without enabling it. By doing so, you are able to continuously integrate new
  developments over time. This guide will briefly introduce automated testing and feature toggles for infrastructure
  code, but will not do a deep dive on the subject. You can learn more about best practices for automated testing in our
  talk
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/new-talk-automated-testing-for-terraform-docker-packer-kubernetes-and-more-cba312171aa6[Automated
  testing for Terraform, Docker, Packer, Kubernetes, and More] and blog post

[[core_concepts]]
== Core Concepts

[[why_is_it_important_to_have_cicd]]
=== Why is it important to have CI/CD?

To understand the benefits of CI/CD, it is worth exploring the opposite: _late integration and late delivery (LI/LD)_.
We will explain LI/LD using a thought experiment about building the International Space Station (ISS).

.Components of the International Space Station
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-cicd-pipeline/iss-components.png[]

The ISS consists of dozens of components, as shown in the image above. Each component is built by a team from a
different country, with a central team responsible for organizing development. In LI/LD,
you would organize the development by designing all the components in advance, and then have each team go
off and work on their component in _total isolation_. There is complete trust in the design and the teams such that
there is no need to check in and integrate the components along the way. When all the teams are done, each team launches
the component into space and then put all the components together at the same time in space, _for the first time_.

It isn't hard to imagine that this could be disastrous: one team would think the other team was responsible for wiring
while that team thought everything would be wireless; all the teams would use the metric system except one; everyone cut
toilets from the scope thinking some other team is sure to include it. Finding all of this out once everything has
already been built and is floating in outer space means that fixing the problems will be very difficult and expensive.

While it is hard to imagine that anyone would build the ISS in this way, unfortunately this model of development is
fairly common in the software industry. Developers work in total isolation for weeks or months at a time on _feature
branches_ without integrating their work with other teams, and then try to merge all the work together at the last
minute moments before release. As a result, the integration process is very expensive and takes days or weeks fixing merge
conflicts, tracking down subtle bugs, and trying to stabilize release branches.

.Many teams employ a practice of working on their features over long periods of time on isolated branches. These long lived feature branches have higher chances of having big conflicts to resolve when integrated.
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-cicd-pipeline/feature-branch-merge-conflict.png[]

In contrast, the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery model of development promotes more cross team
communication and integration work as development progresses. Going back to the ISS thought experiment, a CI/CD style of
building the ISS would work by collaborating on a design. Rather than each team working in isolation, there
would be regular checkpoints throughout the process where the teams come together to try to test and integrate all the
components, and update the design if there are problems. As components are completed and integration tests validate the
design, they are launched into space and assembled incrementally as new components arrive.

Rather than integrating at the last moment, CI/CD encourages development teams to integrate their work together
regularly, with smaller deltas between each change. This exposes problems with the design earlier in the process,
ensuring that there is ample time for improvements and corrections.


[[trunk_based_development_model]]
=== Trunk-based development model

.Trunk branch with a continuous stream of commits.
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-cicd-pipeline/trunk.png[]

The most common way to implement CI/CD is to use a _trunk-based development model_. In trunk-based development, all the
work is done on the same branch, called `trunk` or `master` depending on the Version Control System (VCS). You would
still have feature branches that developers work on to facilitate review processes, but typically these are tiny and
short-lived containing only a handful of commits. Everyone actively merges their work back into trunk on a regular
basis, oftentimes multiple times per day (Continuous Integration). Then, as `trunk` or `master` is updated, the work is
immediately deployed into the active environments so that they can be tested further (Continuous Delivery).

Can having all developers work on a single branch really scale? It turns out that trunk-based development is used by
thousands of developers at https://www.wired.com/2013/04/linkedin-software-revolution/[LinkedIn],
https://paulhammant.com/2013/03/13/facebook-tbd-take-2/[Facebook], and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W71BTkUbdqE[Google]. How are these software giants able to manage active trunks on the
scale of billions of lines of code with 10s of thousands of commits per day?

There are two factors that make this possible:

Small, frequent commits reduce the scope of each integration::
  It turns out that if you integrating small amounts of code on a regular basis, the number of conflicts that arise is
  also fairly small. Instead of having big, monolithic merge conflicts, each conflict that arises will be in a tiny
  portion of the work being integrated. In fact, these conflicts can be viewed as helpful as it is a sign that there is
  a design flaw. These integration challenges are part and parcel to distributed software development projects. You'll have to deal with conflicts no matter what, and it is going
  to be easier to deal with conflicts that arise from one or two days of work than with conflicts that represents months
  of work.

Automated testing::
  When frequent development happens on `trunk`/`master`, naturally it can make the branch unstable. A broken
  `trunk`/`master` is something you want to avoid at all costs in trunk-based development as it could block all
  development. To prevent this, it is important to have a self-testing build with a solid automated testing suite. A
  self-testing build is a fully automated build process that is triggered on any work being committed to the repository.
  The associated test suite should be complete enough that when they pass, you can be confident the code is stable.
  Typically code is only merged into the trunk when the self-testing build passes.


[[types_of_infrastructure_code]]
=== Types of infrastructure code

Before diving into CI/CD workflows, it is important to understand the different types of infrastructure code that is
available. There are two distinct types of infrastructure code:

Infrastructure Modules::
  Modules are bundles of infrastructure code that can be used to deploy a specific component of your architecture.
  For example, many companies have modules for deploying private networks using Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs),
  databases, docker clusters (e.g Elastic Container Service, Kubernetes, Nomad), etc. Think of modules as the
  "blueprints" that define the way your company configures infrastructure.

Live Infrastructure Configurations::
  Live infrastructure configurations are specific parameters for each component in your architecture. The live
  configurations are the frontend for your infrastructure deployments. For example, you might define your dev
  environment as a series of configuration files for the modules that specify the various parameters specific to
  development (e.g sizing small instances, naming them with `dev`, using accounts that are accessible by all developers,
  etc). If the modules are "blueprints" then the live configuration contain the "houses" that were built using the
  "blueprints."

Typically you would have separate repositories for each of these (e.g `infrastructure-modules` for modules and
`infrastructure-live` for live configuration). Organizing your infrastructure code in this way ensures that you can
better test the code before they are used to deploy your environments.

Isolating modules from live configuration allows you to:

Update component infrastructure code without affecting environments::
  If you use versioned, immutable snapshots of the module code, you can decouple the modules from the environments that
  use them. For example, prod might use version `0.4.2` of your RDS module, while dev might be using version `0.5.0`
  which includes a number of improvements to help with debugging performance issues. But since there is a backwards
  incompatibility between the two versions, you are waiting to roll out `0.5.0` to prod until you have a window of
  opportunity to have scheduled downtime with prod. By decoupling the module code from the live infrastructure, you can
  continue improving the component infrastructure code in isolation.

Test infrastructure at the component level::
  Focusing modules down to specific components makes it easier to write tests for your infrastructure code. For example,
  to test your RDS module, you might use relaxed network constraints that make your database wide open at test time. You
  would not want to do this in any environment that runs your application, but when you are focusing on whether or not
  your RDS module deploys a functional database, having to worry about bastion hosts and tunneling requests might get in
  the way. If you were not separating out module code from live configuration, the infrastructure code can't be reused
  to deploy an RDS database in an isolated sandbox account, because it will be hard coded to the specific environment it
  was written for. Testing in this way allows you to build confidence in your infrastructure code prior to rolling it
  out to each environment.

Keep your live configuration DRY::
  Decoupling the component infrastructure code from the environment configurations allows you to reuse the component
  code for each of your environments. Your `dev`, `staging`, and `production` environments are likely to be
  architecturally similar, using the same components across the stack. Like with any code, you don't want to repeat
  yourself with lots of boilerplate, and instead only want to specify what is different across the environments.
  Separating out your code between modules and live configurations allows you to focus the live configuration code on
  reusing the modules across each environment by invoking them with different inputs that are specific to the
  environment.


There are distinct differences in the way the code is tested, used, and deployed between the two flavors of
infrastructure code. These differences are important to consider when designing CI/CD workflows, as they lead to many
differences in the implementation of the pipeline. In the next seciton, we will walk through a typical CI/CD workflow
and compare and contrast the pipeline between the three flavors of code we've talked about so far: application code,
infrastructure modules, and live infrastructure configuration.


[[cicd_workflows]]
=== CI/CD workflows

Now that we have gone over what, why, and how CI/CD works, let's take a look at a more concrete example walking through
the workflow.

The following covers the steps of a typical CI/CD workflow. Any CI/CD workflow, whether it be for infrastructure code or
application code, generally follow these steps. However, the details of some of the steps differ widely. We'll go over
each step of the process and then highlight the differences in implementation for the three flavors of code we covered:
application code, infrastructure modules, and live infrastructure configuration.

For the purposes of illustrating this workflow, we will assume the following:

- The code lives in version control.
- We are using a trunk-based development model.
- The code has already been in development for a while and there is a version running in production.


. <<clone_a_copy_of_the_source_code>>
. <<run_the_code_locally>>
. <<make_code_changes>>
. <<submit_changes_for_review>>
. <<run_automated_tests>>
. <<merge_and_release>>
. <<deploy>>


[[clone_a_copy_of_the_source_code]]
==== Clone a copy of the source code and create a new branch

Typically the first step in making changes to any code base is to clone the repository locally and begin development on
a new branch. Having a local copy makes it easier to iterate on the changes, and using an isolated branch allows you to
push code back to the central repository without breaking the main line of code (trunk) that everyone else is working
on.

It is important to keep the trunk clean in a trunk-based development model, as all new work starts from the trunk.
If the trunk has broken code, then new development can't be done reliably because there will be no way for everyone on
the team to test their code. Note that this branch should be short lived. That is, you should strive to get the work
completed and merged in a few days to avoid large merge conflicts.

If you are using `git`, this step translates to:

----
git clone REPO_URL
git checkout -B NEW_BRANCH_NAME
----

Whether you are developing application code, infrastructure modules, or live infrastructure config, making changes on a
separate branch is a good idea. However, what you do to test that code will be vastly different, as we'll cover in the
next section.


[[run_the_code_locally]]
==== Run the code locally

Before making any code changes, you want to make sure that you are working off of a clean slate. If you start off of
broken code, you won't know if the feature isn't working because of a bug in the trunk, or if it is your code. It is
always a good idea to run the code locally to sanity check the current state of trunk to make sure you are starting from
working code.

How to run the code locally will be very different depending on the type of code you are working with:

Application Code::
  You can typically spin up a local environment for application code to test it out. For example, if you had a simple
  web server written in a general purpose programming language such as Ruby, you can run the server code to bring up a
  local copy of the application that you can interact with (e.g `ruby web-server.rb`). You can then manually test it by
  loading the web server in the browser. Alternatively, you could run the automated test suite associated with your
  application (e.g `ruby web-server-test.rb`). The point is that (almost) everything can be done locally for fast
  iteration.

Infrastructure Modules::
  You will need to bring up live infrastructure to test infrastructure code. Unlike with application code, there is no
  way to have a true and complete local copy of a cloud. Therefore, the only way to know for sure your infrastructure
  code works is by making the actual API calls to the cloud to deploy it. With infrastructure modules, this involves
  deploying the module into a sandbox environment. For example, to test a terraform module, you can define example code
  that sets up the necessary resource dependencies that the module needs, and then deploy that into your sandbox with
  `terraform apply`. You can then inspect the deployed resources to make sure they are functioning as expected. For
  convenience, this process could be captured in an automated test using a framework such as
  https://terratest.gruntwork.io/[Terratest].

Live Infrastructure Config::
  Locally testing live infrastructure config is more difficult than either application code or infrastructure modules.
  Unlike with infrastructure modules, it is difficult to deploy the live infrastructure config temporarily as the code
  is tied to a specific live environment by nature of the code. After all, this is the configuration to manage live
  infrastructure. To illustrate this point, consider a scenario where you are working on adding a new component to your
  environments, and you are at the point of reflecting your changes to prod. Would you want to deploy that code to your
  live production environment off of an unreviewed branch? Given that, the only real test you can do for live
  infrastructure config is to do a dry run of your infrastructure code. Most Infrastructure as Code tools support a dry
  run of the code to check what it would do against your environment. For example, with Terraform, you could run
  `terraform plan` to sanity check the planned actions Terraform will take. This is especially useful for sanity
  checking a fresh clone of the code. The trunk should be a true reflection of the live environment, so you should
  expect there to be no changes to make on a fresh clone of trunk.


[[make_code_changes]]
==== Make code changes

Now that you have a working local copy, you can start to make changes to the code. This process is done iteratively
while checking for validity of the changes along the way with manual or automated testing. It is important to invest
some time and effort in making the feedback cycle short, as it directly translates to your development speed. The faster
you can iterate, the more tests you can run, and the better your code will be.

How you make changes to the code will be largely the same for the three flavors of code we covered, although how you
test your changes and the test cycles will be different. Typically, testing application code can be done in seconds
(because everything is local), and testing live infrastructure config can be done in minutes (because you are only doing
a dry run). However, testing infrastructure modules can take a long time since you need to deploy infrastructure (on the
order of 10s of minutes). For ideas on how to improve the test cycles for infrastructure modules, take a look at
https://terratest.gruntwork.io/docs/testing-best-practices/iterating-locally-using-test-stages/[Iterating locally using
test stages] in the Terratest documentation.


[[submit_changes_for_review]]
==== Submit changes for review

Once the code implementation is done and the testing passes, the next step is to submit it for review. You want to focus
your review process on things that are hard to check through automated testing, such as checking security flaws,
reviewing general code design, enforcing style guides, or identifying potential performance issues on larger data sets.
Code review processes are also a great way to share knowledge across the team. The reviewer will oftentimes share
valuable insights on the code that you might not have thought of.

How thorough the review should be depends on the amount of automated testing. If you have a comprehensive test suite
that everyone on the team has confidence in, then it is not necessary to have a thorough review process. On the other
hand, if you no automated tests or working on an area that can't be tested automatically (e.g live infrastructure code),
then you'll want as many eyes as possible reviewing the code.


[[run_automated_tests]]
==== Run automated tests

To help with code review, you should also set up a CI server (such as Jenkins or CircleCI) with commit hooks that
automatically trigger testing of any branch that is submitted for review. Running the automated tests in this fashion
not only ensures that the code passes all the tests, but also verifies that it runs on multiple platforms and not just
on the developer's local workstation. This is also a good way to run an extensive test suite that takes a long time to
run. Most developers will run a subset of the tests that relate to the feature work being done, as it leads to faster
feedback cycles.

The tests that the CI server runs will be different across the three flavors of code:

Application Code::
  The CI server should run the entire automated test suite for the application code, and report the results as a
  summary. Since automated testing has clear results (whether it failed or passed), you can usually summarize the report
  down to a single icon (a green check mark to indicate success or a red "X" for failure). For reporting failures, most
  CI servers has first class support for consuming the results of the test framework to display cleanly in the UI.

Infrastructure Modules::
  Like with application code, the CI server should run automated tests for infrastructure modules. However, since
  tests for infrastructure modules can cost money and can take a long time to run, it is recommended to only run the
  tests for the modules that changed instead of doing a regression test for all the modules on every commit. You can run
  a nightly build that runs the whole suite on a regular interval that is less frequent than developers updating the
  code. Like with application code, automated infrastructure testing is also very clear when it comes to results so
  you can use the same reporting mechanisms to share results back to the PR.

Live Infrastructure Config::
  For live infrastructure config, the CI server should perform the dry run of the infrastructure and post the entire
  log of the run. Analyzing a plan is hard to automate since the rules surrounding what changes are ok and what changes
  are not is potentially limitless. Therefore, the only way to review the results is by looking at the entire dry run.
  Note that this has potential security issues as the logs for a dry run would typically include secrets. You will want
  to be sensitive to who has access to the logs, and potentially encrypt the results before it is posted.


[[merge_and_release]]
==== Merge and release

Once the code passes automated checks and goes through the review process, it is ready to be integrated into the trunk.
At this point, you have done the best you could to ensure the code won't break the current trunk and additional checks
are likely to hit diminishing returns. Once you merge the code into trunk, you will also want to generate a new,
immutable, versioned release artifact that can be deployed (see
https://blog.gruntwork.io/why-we-use-terraform-and-not-chef-puppet-ansible-saltstack-or-cloudformation-7989dad2865c#b264:[Mutable
infrastructure vs Immutable infrastructure] for a discussion on a benefit of immutable artifacts). What the release
artifact looks like depends on the type of code you are working with:

Application Code::
  The release artifact will vary widely from project to project for application code. This could be anything from a
  source file tarball or a `jar` file executable to a docker image or a VM image. Whatever format the artifact is in,
  make sure the artifact is immutable (i.e., you never change it), and that it has a unique version number (so you can
  distinguish this artifact from all the others).

Infrastructure Modules::
  Infrastructure modules are typically consumed as a library in the tool. Most infrastructure as code tools consume
  libraries directly from a Git repository. For example, with Terraform you can consume modules through module blocks
  that reference a Git repository (see
  https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html[the official documentation] for more details). In this case,
  using a Git tag to mark a revision with a human friendly name is sufficient to generate the release artifact.

Live Infrastructure Config::
  For live infrastructure config, there is typically no release artifact. Live infrastructure code doesn't need to be
  packaged to deploy as it is directly consumable. For example, for Terraform or Terragrunt live config, you can
  directly run `terraform apply` or `terragrunt apply` on the repo. In general, it is not necessary to tag your commits
  for live infrastructure config because in practice you will end up deploying every commit of trunk.


It is worth expanding a bit on the reason why live infrastructure config does not have any release artifact. To
understand this, it is worth looking at what it means to have a working trunk on live infrastructure config. If you
recall from <<run_the_code_locally>>, the only way to test live infrastructure config is by doing a dry run of the code.
If the only way to test live infrastructure config is with dry runs, then you would want to make sure that there are no
new changes to make to the live environments when you start. This is so that you get an accurate representation of the
changes that are being introduced, since you don't want to be differentiating between existing changes that will be
applied from trunk and the changes that will be applied with your new code.

Given that, the definition of a "clean build" for the trunk with live infrastructure config is that a dry run returns no
changes to make. This in turn means that the latest state of trunk that you are working off of, should be a
representation of what is actually deployed in your environments.

This leads to what we call _The Golden Rule of Infrastructure Code:_

*_The master branch of the live repository should be a 1:1 representation of what's actually deployed._*

You will want to do everything that is in your power to maintain this representation to streamline your development.


[[deploy]]
==== Deploy

Now that you have a release artifact, the final stage of the process is to deploy the code. The act of deploying the
code immediately after generating the release is Continuous Deployment (CD).

What it means to "deploy the code" is significantly different across the three flavors. In fact, deploying your
application code and infrastructure modules require changing and deploying live infrastructure config. After all, your
live infrastructure config is a reflection of what's actually deployed, so deploying application or infrastructure
changes require updating the live infrastructure config.

Let's take a look at how to deploy each flavor of code:

Application Code::
  Deploying the release artifact to your environment depends on how the code is packaged. If it is a library, then it
  will be deployed when the application that consumes it updates the library version. In this case, nothing needs to be
  done to deploy it to the application. For services, you would need to deploy the application onto live servers so that
  it is running. For docker images, this might mean updating your service definitions for the docker cluster (e.g ECS or
  Kubernetes). For machine images, this might mean updating your autoscaling group to deploy instances with the new
  image. Regardless of how your application is deployed, it is important to reflect the changes in your live
  infrastructure config to perform the deployment, so that you maintain the Golden Rule of Infrastructure Code. Note
  that there are various strategies for deploying application code, such as canary and blue-green deployments. We will
  not get into details here, but you can refer to our post
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-use-terraform-as-a-team-251bc1104973#7dd3[How to use Terraform as a team] for an
  overview of various rollout strategies.

Infrastructure Modules::
  To deploy your infrastructure modules, you need to create or update references to the modules in your live
  infrastructure config. If the module is already deployed, this may be as simple as bumping the ref tag in your live
  config. However, if the module is being deployed for the first time, then this will require creating a new
  configuration in your live infrastructure config to deploy the module. In either case, the only way to deploy
  infrastructure modules is by making the corresponding edits to the live infrastructure config to roll out the changes
  across your environments. Note that because infrastructure changes are higher risk than application code, you will
  want to make sure to roll out your infrastructure in stages. That is, you should fully roll out the changes in a
  pre-prod environment before moving on to deploying in prod.

Live Infrastructure Config::
  For live infrastructure config, deploying the code is the act of applying the code to the live environment. This
  depends on the tool. For example, your terraform code can be applied with `terraform apply` or `terragrunt apply`,
  while Kubernetes manifests require `kubectl apply`.


Regardless of the code, the important thing about the deployment process is that you should automate as many steps of
the process as possible. Just like with automated testing on code review, you should set up a CI server to automatically
deploy your code across the various environments, to the extent that it is safe. You can automate many steps of the
deployment depending on the risk profile of the change:

Application Code::
  For application code, you should be able to automate the entire deployment as the surface area of each change should
  be fairly small and localized to just the application. Additionally, application code have standard rollback
  practices that make it easy to undo. Automating the deployment of application code requires automatically patching
  your live infrastructure config. In most cases, the changes are simple enough that a single regex or sed call should
  be sufficient (e.g bumping the version tag of a docker image). Note that the roll out of the deployment should be
  handled as part of the automated deployment of the live infrastructure config.

Infrastructure Modules::
  With infrastructure modules, depending on which module is being updated, an automated deployment may be risky. In a
  world where a single name change could cause the database to be recreated, it pays off to be extra cautious with the
  deployment. At most, you should only automatically deploy infrastructure modules to a sandbox or dev environment,
  where the damage from a catastrophic failure causing the environment to be taken down is limited. Similar to
  application code, automating this process could be handled with a regex or sed call that updates the ref tag in the
  live infrastructure config, with the rollout being handled by the automated deployment pipeline for that code.

Live Infrastructure Config::
  Similar to infrastructure modules, automatically deploying live infrastructure code without any oversight might be
  risky depending on the change. You may want to automate specific infrastructure deployments that happen frequently and
  are low risk (e.g deploying your application), but automating arbitrary infrastructure changes that may include
  destroying your productiond database is not advisable. With that said, it is not practical to always manually roll out
  deployments, and in some circumstances that can be more risky from a security perspective (e.g increasing attack
  surface by passing out admin credentials to all your developers). A typical workflow for deploying live infrastructure
  config is to have the CI server perform a dry run first, and ask for approval from an admin before proceeding to apply
  the change.


==== Summary

To summarize, here is a table highlighting each step of a typical CI/CD workflow and how it is implemented with each
flavor of code:

The rest of the document will discuss how we can implement the automated pieces of the workflow in a secure manner that
is ready for production. To start, let's take a step back and define a threat model for CI/CD. This threat model will
help us ensure that we implement the necessary security controls in these CI/CD pipelines so that we cover the common
types of attack vectors for this type of workflow.


[[threat_model_of_cicd]]
=== Threat model of CI/CD

The threat model of CI/CD is different between application code, infrastructure modules, and live infrastructure config.
This largely stems from the amount of permissions required to implement each workflow:

.Permissions needed for CI/CD of each code type.
[cols="1h,2,2,2"]
|===
|Permissions |Application Code |Infrastructure Modules |Live Infrastructure Config

|CI server logs
|Limited (typically only need summary report as you can reproduce failures locally)
|Full (can not debug without seeing the full deployment log)
|Full (can not debug without seeing the full deployment log)

|Sandbox environments

|Full

|Non-prod environments
|Limited (minimal necessary to deploy artifact)
|None

|Prod environments
|Limited (minimal necessary to deploy artifact)
|None
|Full

|===

Note how CI/CD for infrastructure code requires full permissions to CI logs as well as at least one of your
environments, whereas application code can be deployed with limited permissions to the environments. This difference is
due to the fact that infrastructure modules and live infrastructure config can be used to manage any infrastructure
deployed in your environments, whereas application code is scoped to infrastructure that is relevant to the application.
Given that, the threat against CI/CD in infrastructure code is orders of magnitude higher than with application code.

Compromising the credentials used for application code may be used to take down your application in a denial of service,
but most likely will not affect databases and backups, making it recoverable after locking out the attacker.

Compromising the credentials used for infrastructure modules can cause an attacker to maliciously use your cloud
environments for various purposes, potentially costing you lots of money, but will not affect your production
environment and application. In most cases though, you can recover the costs by reporting fraud. AWS for
example is known to refund bills of accounts that were compromised.

However, compromising the credentials used for live infrastructure config can cause an attacker to do anything including
deleting all your backups. This is potentially a business ending event.

In this section we will focus on the threat model for CI/CD on live infrastructure config. However, the threats and
mitigation tactics covered are generally applicable to CI/CD for all three flavors of code.

A threat model explicitly covers what attacks are taken into consideration in the design, as well as what attacks are
__not__ considered. The goal of the threat model is to be realistic about the threats that are addressable with the
tools available. By explicitly focusing attention on more likely and realistic threats, we can avoid overengineering and
compromising the usability of the solution against threats that are unlikely to exist (e.g a 5 person startup with 100
end users is unlikely to be the subject of a targeted attack by a government agency).

In this guide, the following threat assumptions are made:

- Attackers' goals are to gain access to an environment that they do not already have access to. Access to an
  environment includes but is not limited to:
    - The ability to read secrets that grant access to potentially sensitive data (e.g the database in prod
      environment).
    - Full access over all resources to cause damage to the business (e.g ability to delete the database and all its
      backups in prod).

- Attackers can originate from both external and internal sources (in relation to the organization).
- External attacks are limited to those that can get full access to a CI environment, but not the underlying source
  code. Note that __any__ CI/CD solution can likely be compromised if an attacker has access to your source code.
- Internal attackers are limited to those with restricted access to the environments. This means that the threat model
  does not consider highly trusted insiders who abuse their privileges with malicious intent.
  internal ops admin with full access to the prod environment). However, an internal attacker with permissions in the
  dev environment trying to elevate their access to the prod environment is considered.
- Similarly, internal attackers are limited to those with restricted access in the CI environment and git repository. A
  threat where the internal attackers can bypass admin approval in a CI pipeline or can force push deployment branches
  is not considered.
- Internal attackers can have (limited) access to the CI environment and the underlying code of the infrastructure (e.g
  the git repository).

With this threat model in mind, let's take a look at the different CI/CD platforms.


[[cicd_platforms]]
=== CI/CD platforms

Over the years as practices for CI/CD for application code developed many platforms emerged to support CI/CD workflows
triggered from source control. Here we will list out a few of the major CI/CD platforms that exist to support these
workflows. Note that this isn't an exhaustive list or an endorsement of the platforms that are listed here. The goal of
this section is to give a few examples of existing platforms and solutions, and cover the trade offs that you should
consider when selecting a platform to implement your workflow on. The production-grade design that we cover in the guide
is compatible with almost any generic CI/CD platform that you select, but is an alternative to the specialized platforms
for infrastructure code.

In general, CI/CD platforms fit one of two categories: self-hosted or SaaS. Self-hosted CI/CD platforms are designed as
infrastructure that you run in your data center and cloud for managing the infrastructure in your account, while SaaS
CI/CD platforms are hosted by the vendor that provides the platform. In most cases, SaaS platforms are preferred to
self-hosted platforms to avoid the overhead of maintaining additional infrastructure to enable developer workflows,
which not only cost money but also time from your operations team to maintain the infrastructure with patches, upgrades,
uptime, etc. However, in certain fields with strict compliance requirements, it is unavoidable to have self-hosted CI/CD
platforms due to the threat model and the amount of permissions that are granted to the platform to ensure the software
can be deployed. These fields manage sensitive data that make it hard to entrust third-party platforms that are publicly
accessible with the "keys to the kingdom" that hold that data.

Additionally, CI/CD platforms can be further divided into generic platforms for any code, and specialized platforms for
application code or infrastructure code. Depending on your use case, it may be desirable to use a specialized platform
that accelerates the implementation of specific workflows as opposed to configuring a generic platform.

Here are a few examples of well-known platforms, the general category that they fit in, major features that the platform
provides, as well as how they mitigate the threat model that we cover:

https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins] (self-hosted, generic)::
  One of the oldest CI/CD platforms, with its history going as far back as 2005 (when it was previously called
  _Hudson_). Jenkins is a popular and generic platform that can be configured to support almost any kind of CI/CD, with
  a wide range of plugins that enhance the experience. However, given the role that it plays in organizations, combined
  with its nature of being a popular, open source platform, it is the target of frequent attacks and vulnerabilities.
  Most vulnerabilities are mitigated by locking down the platform so that it is only internally accessible within a
  corporate network over VPN, as well as by keeping the server, the Jenkins software, and the Jenkins plugins frequently patched. This does mean that you shouldn't
  expose the server externally to implement webhook based workflows, but rather rely on polling to detect changes.
  Jenkins also provides a wide range of fine-grained permissions in its user model that allows you to lock down the
  actions that your internal users can take.

https://circleci.com/[CircleCI] (SaaS, generic)::
  CircleCI is a generic SaaS CI/CD platform that is more optimized for CI/CD workflows for application code than
  infrastructure CI/CD, although it can be configured to implement infrastructure CI/CD workflows. It has first class
  support for various application based workflows like parsing test results into a nice report in the UI, reacting to
  version control events, and official docker containers for various programming languages and frameworks. However, it
  does not have first class support for features that are useful with infrastructure code, such as encrypting logs
  and fine grained permissions. The strength of CircleCI lies in the simplicity of its infrastructure. Being a fully
  managed SaaS platform with first class support for a wide range of platforms, it is fairly easy to get up and running
  on the platform in a matter of minutes. However, the downside is that you must be comfortable with using a SaaS
  platform for your CI/CD workflows and having it hold your secrets that provide access to your infrastructure. Note
  that CircleCI employs a respectable security model, having passed numerous compliance audits including FedRAMP. They
  provide a wide variety of features to mitigate potential threats, including runtime environment isolation, restricted
  contexts for finer grained permissions modeling, and audit logging to continuously monitor access.

https://about.gitlab.com/[GitLab] (self-hosted and SaaS, generic)::
  GitLab is an all comprehensive platform that supports both a self-hosted mode (enterprise) or SaaS platform. Since
  GitLab also provides hosting for git repositories, it creates a tight integration between the git workflows and the
  CI/CD workflows that you can implement on the platform. Although GitLab is a generic CI/CD platform that can be
  configured to run any workflow, GitLab also provides specialized workflows for popular infrastructure platforms like
  Kubernetes. Some of its continuous deployment features include first class support for feature toggles, canary
  deployments, and building docker images. While the SaaS platform is subject to external attacks, GitLab employs a
  respectable security model with end to end encryption, frequent testing, and compliance audits, in addition to being
  an open source and open core platform that allows for wider inspection and review of its practices. For those that can
  not rely on the SaaS platform for CI/CD, you can always run GitLab EE in your own data center.

https://www.runatlantis.io/[Atlantis] (self-hosted, specialized)::
  Atlantis is an open source tool optimized for git based Terraform workflows, with additional support for Terragrunt.
  At its core, the platform will automatically run `terraform plan` on commits and annotate any open Pull Requests with
  the `plan` output. This `plan` is stored in plan file format so that when upon merge, the exact plan is applied using
  `terraform apply`. Note that Atlantis is optimized for this single workflow. That is, it cannot be made to implement
  other workflows, such as building images or running infrastructure tests using terratest. Being a self-hosted
  platform, you can keep your credentials internal to your data center and lock down server level access. However,
  Atlantis requires a public-facing endpoint to be available so that it can listen on webhooks from the major VCS
  platforms (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket/Azure DevOps). This means that you are relying on the security model of the
  Atlantis platform to ensure that it doesn't accidentally run infrastructure code from unwanted sources with the
  credentials of the platform. To prevent unwanted deployments, you will want to ensure that you are following
  https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/security.html#mitigations[all the security best practices] of the platform.

https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/[Terraform Enterprise and Terraform Cloud] (self-hosted and SaaS, specialized)::
  Terraform Cloud (SaaS) and Terraform Enterprise (self-hosted) are platforms provided by HashiCorp (the creator of
  Terraform) that are optimized for Terraform workflows. Both services provide a web UI for remotely running `terraform
  plan` and `terraform apply`, and can be integrated with VCS platforms to implement CI/CD workflows that remotely run
  `terraform` in reaction to git. Additionally, Terraform Enterprise in particular provides the ability to manage
  deployment policies and permissions as code. Note that Terraform Cloud and Enterprise are both optimized for running
  `terraform`. That is, they do not support the use of external binaries such as `terragrunt` or `docker`, even when
  called from within `terraform` using a `local-exec` provisioner or external data source. In terms of the threat model,
  Terraform Cloud and Enterprise both implement respectable security practices, including end to end encryption backed
  by HashiCorp Vault, and you have the option to run in your own data center with Terraform Enterprise to lock it down.
  Note that Terraform Enterprise relies on API based integrations with the VCS platforms instead of webhooks, so it is
  not necessary to have a publicly facing service when running in self-hosted mode.

Here is a table that highlights some of the features of each CI platform and their strengths and weaknesses that can be
useful in making tradeoffs:

[[production_grade_design]]
== Production-grade design

With all the core concepts out of the way, let's now discuss how to configure a production-grade CI/CD workflow for
infrastructure code, using a platform that looks something like this:

.Architecture of platform for running Terraform/Terragrunt CI/CD workflows.
image::/assets/img/guides/infrastructure-cicd-pipeline/tftg-pipeline-architecture.png[]


[[use_generic_cicd_platforms_as_a_workflow_engine_but_run_infrastructure_deployments_from_within_your_account]]
=== Use generic CI/CD platforms as a workflow engine but run infrastructure deployments from within your account

As we covered in the <<cicd_platforms>> section of the Core Concepts, all CI/CD platforms support some form of
integration with VCS repositories. Additionally, CI/CD platforms are optimized for implementing workflows and pipelines
that react to VCS activities. They all support a way to start executing a pipeline on commits, approval steps in the
pipeline, and a way to report back to the VCS repository by annotating commits with the status of a pipeline execution.
With the abundance of CI/CD platforms out there, you are bound to find one that suits your needs. It doesn't matter
which one you use, but be sure to choose one that has enough support for your application code so that you can use the
same platform for both application and infrastructure CI/CD workflows. In addition, we recommend selecting a SaaS
based CI/CD platform to avoid the overhead of managing additional infrastructure for the VCS integration and workflow
execution.

However, instead of relying on the CI/CD platform to run infrastructure deployments (e.g calling `terraform apply`), use
a specialized self-hosted deployment platform for running your infrastructure deployments. This can be Terraform
Enterprise if you are only using `terraform`, or Gruntwork's ECS Deploy Runner stack for a more general purpose
platform. In order to support arbitrary infrastructure deployments, it will be inevitable that the system running your
deployments will have de facto admin status to the environments that you are deploying into. As such, it is important
that these systems are locked down. You do not want any third party publicly facing system to hold powerful credentials
to your cloud environments.

This design implements separation of the concerns so that we take full advantage of the strengths of each platform,
while covering the weaknesses: relying on the CI/CD platforms to manage the workflow/pipeline, but have it trigger
infrastructure deployments on self-hosted systems that are more locked down. In this model, the CI/CD platforms only
need enough permissions to trigger a deployment, but not necessarily all the permissions required for running a
deployment. Instead, you can have a system that is closed off in your isolated network hold the credentials
necessary to actually run the deployment.


[[use_serverless_platforms_for_infrastructure_deployments]]
=== Use serverless platforms for infrastructure deployments

For running infrastructure deployments, choose a system that makes use of serverless platforms. For example, Gruntwork's
ECS Deploy Runner utilizes ECS Fargate to run the infrastructure code, with AWS Lambda as a frontend to provide a
callable function (driven by the AWS SDK and authorization managed by IAM). By utilizing Fargate and AWS Lambda, we have
a purely serverless architecture where no infrastructure needs to be managed, and IAM credentials are short lived. This
not only helps reduce the overhead of running the system, but it also helps reduce the attack surface (e.g you don't
have to worry about a permanent, externally available server that needs to be constantly patched).


[[use_a_vpc_to_lock_down_infrastructure_deployer]]
=== Use a VPC to lock down infrastructure deployer

Run your infrastructure deployment workloads in a https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/[Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)] to isolate
the workloads in a restricted network topology (see link:/guides/networking/how-to-deploy-production-grade-vpc-aws[How
to deploy a production-grade VPC on AWS] for more information on VPCs). Configure to run all workloads in private
subnets that are not publicly accessible.


[[use_minimal_iam_permissions_for_a_deployment]]
=== Use minimal IAM permissions for a deployment

Avoid having a single system with admin permissions for running a deployment. Instead, deploy specialized versions of
the deployment platforms with varying permissions for handling specific workflows. By separating out the concerns for
each pipeline, you can reduce the blast radius of the damage that can be done with each set of credentials. At a minimum,
you should have two versions of the infrastructure deployment system: one for deploying the application code, and which
only has the minimal permissions necessary for deploying that application; and one for deploying infrastructure code,
which has full access to the environments.


[[use_approval_flows]]
=== Use approval flows

It is important that human review is baked into each deployment. As covered in <<cicd_for_infrastructure_code>>, it is
difficult to build an automated test suite that builds enough confidence in your infrastructure code to do the right
thing. This is important, as failed infrastructure deployments could be catastrophic to your business, and there is no
concept of rollback with infrastructure deployment tools. This means that you will almost always want to have some form
of approval workflow for your infrastructure CI/CD pipeline so that you can review what is about to be deployed. Most
generic CI/CD platforms support approval workflows. For example, CircleCI supports
https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/#holding-a-workflow-for-a-manual-approval[approval steps in its workflow
engine], in addition to https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/#restricting-a-context[restricted contexts] to limit who
can approve the workflow.


[[lock_down_vcs_systems]]
=== Lock down VCS systems

It is a good practice to define and store the deployment pipeline as code in the same repo that it is used. For example,
you should define the CI/CD deployment pipeline for your infrastructure code in the `modules` and `live` repositories.
However, this means that anyone with access to those repositories are free to modify the pipeline, __even on feature
branches__. This can be exploited to skip any approval process you have defined in the pipeline by creating a new branch
that overwrites the pipeline configuration.

This is not a concern if only admin users had access to the infrastructure code. Typically, however, many operations
teams want contributions to the infrastructure code from developers as well, and having any developer have the ability to
deploy arbitrary infrastructure to production without any review can be undesirable. To mitigate these concerns, you
should lock down your VCS systems:

Only deploy from protected branches::
  In most git hosting platforms, there is a concept of protected branches (see
  https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches[GitHub docs] for example).
  Protected branches allow you to implement policies for controlling what code can be merged in. For most platforms, you
  can protect a branch such that: (a) it can never be force pushed, (b) it can never be merged to or commit to from the
  cli, (c) merges require status checks to pass, (d) merges require approval from N reviewers. By only building CI
  pipelines from protected branches, you can add checks and balances to ensure a review of potentially harmful
  infrastructure actions.

Consider a forking based workflow for pull requests::
  When exposing your repository to a wider audience for contribution, you can consider implementing a forking based
  workflow. In this model, you only allow your trusted admins to have access to the main infrastructure repo, but anyone
  on the team can read and fork the code. When non-admins want to implement changes, instead of branching from the repo,
  they will fork the repo, implement changes on their fork, and then open a PR from the fork. The advantage of this
  approach is that many CI platforms do not automatically run builds from a fork for security reasons. Instead, admins
  manually trigger a build by pushing the forked branch to an internal branch. While this is an inconvenience to devs as
  you won't automatically see the `plan`, it prevents unwanted access to secrets by modifying the CI pipeline to log
  internal environment variables or show infrastructure secrets using external data sources.


[[summary_of_mitigations]]
=== Summary of mitigations

With this production design in mind, let's take a look at how each of the design decisions addresses the concerns of the
threat model:

Minimal access to target environments::
  All the infrastructure is deployed from within the accounts using a serverless platform. This means that attackers
  that gain access to the underlying AWS secrets used by the CI environments will at most have the ability to run
  deployments against a predefined set of code. This means that external attackers who do not have access to the source
  code will at most be able to: (a) deploy code that has already been deployed before, (b) see the plan of the
  infrastructure between two points of time. They will not be able to write arbitrary infrastructure code to read DB
  secrets, for example. It is important to note that the IAM policies are set up such that the IAM user for CI only has
  access to trigger predefined events. They do not have access to arbitrarily invoke the ECS task, as that could
  potentially expose arbitrary deployments by modifying the command property (e.g use a command to `echo` some
  infrastructure code and run `terraform`).
    - Note that there is still a risk of rolling back the existing infrastructure by attempting to deploy a previous
      version. See below for potential ways to mitigate this type of attack.
    - Similarly, this alone does not mitigate threats from internal attackers who have access to the source code, as a
      potential attacker with access to the source code can write arbitrary code to destroy or lookup arbitrary
      infrastructure in the target environment. See below for potential ways to mitigate this type of attack.

Minimal options for deployment::
  The Lambda function exposes a minimal interface for triggering deployments. Attackers will only be able to trigger a
  deployment against a known repo and known git refs (branches, tags, etc). To further limit the scope, the lambda
  function can be restricted to only allow references to repositories that matches a predefined regular expression.
  Terraform Enterprise exposes similar configuration parameters to restrict what deployments can be triggered. This
  prevents attackers from creating an open source repo with malicious code that they subsequently deploy by pointing the
  deploy runner to it.

Restricted refs for `apply`::
  Since many CI systems depend on the pipeline being managed as code in the same repository, internal attackers can
  easily circumvent approval flows by modifying the CI configuration on a test branch. This means that potential
  attackers can run an `apply` to destroy the environment or open backdoors by running infrastructure code from test
  branches without having the code approved. To mitigate this, the Lambda function allows specifying a list of git refs
  (branches, tags, etc) as the source of `apply` and `apply-all`. If you limit the source of `apply` to only protected
  branches (see below), it prevents attackers from having the ability to run `apply` unless it has been reviewed.

CI server does not need access to the source code::
  Since the deployments are being done remotely in separate infrastructure, the actual CI server does not need to clone the
  underlying repository to deploy the infrastructure. This means that you can design your CI pipeline to only have
  access to the webhook events and possibly the change list of files (to know which module to deploy), but not the
  source code itself. This can further decrease the effect of a potential breach of the CI server, as the attacker will
  not have the ability to read or modify the infrastructure code to use the pipeline to their advantage.

These mitigations alone will not prevent all attacks defined in the threat model. For example, an internal
attacker with access to the source code can still do damage to the target environments by merging in code that removes
all the infrastructure resources, thereby destroying all infrastructure when the `apply` command is run. Or, they could
expose secrets by writing infrastructure code that will leak the secrets in the logs via a `local-exec` provisioner.
Note that __any__ CI/CD solution can likely be compromised if an attacker has full access to your source code.

For these types of threats, your best bet is to implement various policies and controls on the source control repository
and build configurations:

<<use_approval_flows>>::
  In addition to providing a moment to pause and inspect the exact infrastructure changes that are about to be deployed,
  approval workflows in the CI server can mitigate attacks such that attackers will need enough privileges on the CI
  server to approve builds in order to actually modify infrastructure. This can mitigate potential attacks where the
  attacker has access to the CI server to trigger arbitrary builds manually (e.g to run a previous job that is deploying
  an older version to roll back the infrastructure), but not enough access to approve the job. Note that this will not
  mitigate potential threats from internal attackers who have enough permissions to approve builds.

<<lock_down_vcs_systems>>::
  As mentioned in the previous section, it is important that you implement various controls on the VCS repositories.
  Once you implement a CI/CD pipeline, access to source code translates to access to your infrastructure environments,
  so you will want to reflect the same kind of security controls you implement on your environments in your VCS
  repositories.

Avoid logging secrets::
  Our threat model assumes that attackers can get access to the CI servers, which means they will have access to the
  deployment logs. This will include detailed outputs from a `terraform plan` or `apply`. While it is impossible to
  prevent terraform from leaking secrets into the state, it is possible to avoid terraform from logging sensitive
  information. Make use of PGP encryption functions or encrypted environment variables / config files (in the case of
  service deployments) to ensure sensitive data does not show up in the plan output. Additionally, tag sensitive outputs
  with the `sensitive` keyword so that terraform will mask the outputs.


=== Summary of deployment sequence

To put it all together, the following sequence diagram shows how all the various components work together:

[[deployment_walkthrough]]
== Deployment walkthrough

Let’s now walk through the step-by-step process of how to create a production-grade CI/CD pipeline for your
infrastructure code, fully defined and managed as code, using the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library and CircleCI
as the CI server. Although this guide uses CircleCI, the configuration can be adapted with any CI platform.

We will implement the following workflow for `live` infrastructure:

[[pre_requisites]]
=== Pre-requisites

This walkthrough has the following pre-requisites:

Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library::
  This guide uses code from the https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library], as it
  implements most of the production-grade design for you out of the box. Make sure to read
  link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library[How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library].
+
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork subscriber# to access the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library.

Terraform::
  This guide uses https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform] to define and manage all the infrastructure as code. If you're
  not familiar with Terraform, check out https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-terraform-b3d32832baca[A
  Comprehensive Guide to Terraform], https://training.gruntwork.io/p/terraform[A Crash Course on Terraform], and
  link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library[How to Use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library]

CircleCI::
  This guide uses https://circleci.com/[CircleCI] as the CI platform. Although the approach is compatible with any CI
  platform, a basic understanding of the CircleCI configuration will be useful for translating the configuration format
  to other platforms. You can take a look at https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/getting-started/#section=getting-started[the
  official getting started guide] to get a basic understanding of CircleCI and their configuration format.

AWS accounts::
  This guide deploys infrastructure into one or more AWS accounts. Check out the
  link:/guides/foundations/how-to-configure-production-grade-aws-account-structure[Production Grade AWS Account Structure] guide for instructions.
  You will also need to be able to authenticate to these accounts on the CLI: check out
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-authenticating-to-aws-on-the-command-line-63656a686799[A Comprehensive Guide to Authenticating to AWS on the Command Line]
  for instructions.

Repository structure::
  This guide assumes your infrastructure code is organized in a manner similar to that covered in the
  https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/#using_terraform_modules[Using
  Terraform Modules section of the How to Use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library] guide. This means that you
  should have two repositories for your infrastructure code, `infrastructure-modules` and `infrastructure-live`. Make
  sure that the `infrastructure-live` repository is locked down as recommended in <<lock_down_vcs_systems>>. This guide
  will assume that `master` is the protected branch where infrastructure is deployed from.

NOTE: This guide will use https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt[Terragrunt] and its associated file and folder
structure to deploy Terraform modules. Please note that *Terragrunt is NOT required for using Terraform modules from
the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library.* Check out
link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library[How to Use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library] for instructions
on alternative options, such as how to
link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library#deploy_using_plain_terraform[Deploy using plain Terraform].


=== Deploy a VPC

The first step is to deploy a VPC. Follow the instructions in
link:/guides/networking/how-to-deploy-production-grade-vpc-aws[How to deploy a production-grade VPC on AWS] to use
`module-vpc` to create a VPC setup that looks like this:

.A production-grade VPC setup deployed using module-vpc from the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library
image::/assets/img/guides/vpc/vpc-diagram.png[]

We will use the Mgmt VPC to deploy our infrastructure deployment CD platform, since the infrastructure deployment
platform is a management infrastructure that is designed to deploy to multiple environments.

After following this guide, you should have a `vpc-mgmt` wrapper module in your `infrastructure-modules` repo:

----
infrastructure-modules
  └ networking
    └ vpc-mgmt
      └ main.tf
      └ outputs.tf
      └ variables.tf
----

Here's a snippet of what the code in the `vpc-mgmt` wrapper module looks like:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "vpc" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest module-vpc release
  source = "git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-vpc.git//modules/vpc-mgmt?ref=<VERSION>"

  vpc_name         = var.vpc_name
  aws_region       = var.aws_region
  cidr_block       = var.cidr_block
  num_nat_gateways = var.num_nat_gateways
}

# ... (the rest of the code is ommitted) ...
----

You should also have a corresponding live configuration in your `infrastructure-live` repo to deploy the VPC. For
example, for your production environment, there should be a folder called `production` in the `infrastructure-live` repo
that looks as follows:

----
infrastructure-live
  └ production
    └ terragrunt.hcl
    └ us-east-2
      └ prod
        └ networking
          └ vpc-mgmt
            └ terragrunt.hcl
----

Here's a snippet of what the code in the `vpc-mgmt` Terragrunt configuration file looks like:

.infrastructure-live/production/us-east-2/prod/networking/vpc-mgmt/terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
# Pull in the backend and provider configurations from a root terragrunt.hcl file that you include in each child terragrunt.hcl:
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

# Set the source to an immutable released version of the infrastructure module being deployed:
terraform {
  source = "git@github.com/<YOUR_ORG>/infrastructure-modules.git//networking/vpc-mgmt?ref=v0.3.0"
}

# Configure input values for the specific environment being deployed:
inputs = {
  aws_region       = "us-east-2"
  aws_account_id   = "111122223333"
  vpc_name         = "mgmt-prod"
  cidr_block       = "10.0.0.0/16"
  num_nat_gateways = 3
}
----

=== Deploy the ECS Deploy Runner

// TODO: update link to use service catalog so it is publicly visiable
For this guide, we will use
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci/blob/master/README-Terraform-Terragrunt-Pipeline.adoc[Gruntwork's ECS Deploy
Runner stack] as our infrastructure deployment CD platform. We will deploy the stack into the private subnet of our
mgmt VPC using the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci/tree/master/modules/ecs-deploy-runner[ecs-deploy-runner
module] in `module-ci`.

To deploy the ECS Deploy Runner, we will follow three steps:

- <<create_ecr_repo>>
- <<create_docker_image>>
- <<deploy_ecs_deploy_runner_stack>>

[[create_ecr_repo]]
==== Create ECR repo

The ECS Deploy Runner uses an ECS Task to run the infrastructure deployment. In order to run the ECS task, we need a
Docker image that contains all the necessary software for the deployment, as well as an ECR repository to store that
Docker image. We will start by creating the ECR repo.

Create a new module called `ecr-repo` in `infrastructure-modules`:

----
infrastructure-modules
  └ cicd
    └ ecr-repo
      └ main.tf
      └ outputs.tf
      └ variables.tf
  └ networking
    └ vpc-mgmt
      └ main.tf
      └ outputs.tf
      └ variables.tf
----

Inside of `main.tf`, configure the ECR repository:

.infrastructure-modules/cicd/ecr-repo/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
resource "aws_ecr_repository" "repo" {
  name                 = var.name

  image_scanning_configuration {
    scan_on_push = true
  }
}
----

This defines a new ECR repository with a name configured by an input variable and indicates that images should be
scanned automatically on push.

Add the corresponding `name` variable to `variables.tf`:

.infrastructure-modules/cicd/ecr-repo/variables.tf
[source,hcl]
----
variable "name" {
  description = "The name of the ECR repository to be created."
  type        = string
}
----

Also make sure that the repository URL is exposed in `outputs.tf`, as we will need it later when deploying the ECS
Deploy Runner:

.infrastructure-modules/cicd/ecr-repo/outputs.tf
[source,hcl]
----
output "url" {
  description = "The Docker URL for the created ECR repository. This can be used as the push URL for containers."
  value       = aws_ecr_repository.repo.repository_url
}
----

At this point, you'll want to test your code. See
link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library#manual_tests_terraform[Manual tests for Terraform code]
and
link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library#automated_tests_terraform[Automated tests for Terraform code]
for instructions.

Once your `ecr-repo` module is working the way you want, submit a pull request, get your changes merged into the
`master` branch, and create a new versioned release by using a Git tag. For example, to create a `v0.5.0` release:

[source,bash]
----
git tag -a "v0.5.0" -m "Added module for creating ECR repositories"
git push --follow-tags
----

Now that we have a module for managing an ECR repo, head over to your `infrastructure-live` repo and add a
`terragrunt.hcl` file for creating the ECR repo for the ECS deploy runner:

----
infrastructure-live
  └ production
    └ terragrunt.hcl
    └ us-east-2
      └ prod
        └ cicd
          └ ecr-repo
            └ terragrunt.hcl
        └ networking
          └ vpc-mgmt
            └ terragrunt.hcl
----

.infrastructure-live/production/us-east-2/prod/cicd/ecr-repo/terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
# Pull in the backend and provider configurations from a root terragrunt.hcl file that you include in each child terragrunt.hcl:
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

# Set the source to an immutable released version of the infrastructure module being deployed:
terraform {
  source = "git@github.com/<YOUR_ORG>/infrastructure-modules.git//cicd/ecr-repo?ref=v0.5.0"
}

# Configure input values for the specific environment being deployed:
inputs = {
  name = "ecs-deploy-runner"
}
----

And run `terragrunt apply` to deploy the changes:

[source,bash]
----
cd infrastructure-live/production/us-east-2/prod/cicd/ecr-repo
terragrunt apply
----

Make sure to note the repository URL. You can store it in an environment variable for easy reference when building the
Docker image:

[source,bash]
----
cd infrastructure-live/production/us-east-2/prod/cicd/ecr-repo
export ECR_REPO_URL=$(terragrunt output url)
----



[[create_docker_image]]
==== Create Docker Image

Once we have the ECR repository to house Docker images, we need to create the Docker image for the infrastructure
deployer. This Docker image should contain everything you need to deploy your infrastructure, such as `terraform` and
`terragrunt`. In addition, the Docker image should include the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci/tree/master/modules/infrastructure-deploy-script[infrastructure-deploy-script].
This is a python script that does the following:

- Clone the repository containing the infrastructure code using git.
- Change the working directory to the desired path passed in the parameters.
- Run `terraform` or `terragrunt` with `plan` or `apply` depending on the passed in parameters, streaming the output to
  `stdout` and `stderr`.
- Exit with the appropriate exit code depending on if the underlying command succeeded or failed.

Create a placeholder module called `ecs-deploy-runner` in `infrastructure-modules`, with a folder `docker` with the
`Dockerfile` for creating the Docker image and the `known_hosts` file. Copy over the `Dockerfile` and `known_hosts` file
from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci/tree/master/modules/ecs-deploy-runner/docker[module-ci]:

----
infrastructure-modules
  └ cicd
    └ ecs-deploy-runner
      └ docker
        └ Dockerfile
        └ known_hosts
    └ ecr-repo
      └ main.tf
      └ outputs.tf
      └ variables.tf
  └ networking
    └ vpc-mgmt
      └ main.tf
      └ outputs.tf
      └ variables.tf
----

This `Dockerfile` includes various tools and utilities that are necessary for deploying anything from the Gruntwork
Infrastructure as Code Library. You should modify this `Dockerfile` to include additional tools that are necessary for
your environment.

Next, build the Docker image locally:

[source,bash]
----
cd infrastructure-modules/cicd/ecs-deploy-runner/docker
# Make sure you have set the environment variable GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN with a GitHub personal access token that has access
# to the Gruntwork repositories
docker build --build-arg GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN --tag "$ECR_REPO_URL:v1" .
----

Then, push the Docker image to the ECR repository so that it is available to ECS:

[source,bash]
----
# Authenticate docker so that you can access the ECR Repository
eval "$(aws ecr get-login --region "us-east-2" --no-include-email)"
docker push "$ECR_REPO_URL:v1"
----


[[deploy_ecs_deploy_runner_stack]]
==== Deploy ECS Deploy Runner stack

Once we have the ECR repo with an available Docker image, it is time to configure the ECS task and Lambda function
invoker. We will deploy both using the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci/tree/master/modules/ecs-deploy-runner[ecs-deploy-runner module] in
`module-ci`.

Add the Terraform files for the `ecs-deploy-runner` in `infrastructure-modules`:

----
infrastructure-modules
  └ cicd
    └ ecs-deploy-runner
      └ docker
        └ Dockerfile
        └ known_hosts
      └ main.tf
      └ variables.tf
    └ ecr-repo
      └ main.tf
      └ outputs.tf
      └ variables.tf
  └ networking
    └ vpc-mgmt
      └ main.tf
      └ outputs.tf
      └ variables.tf
----

Inside of `main.tf`, configure the ECS Deploy Runner:

.infrastructure-modules/cicd/ecs-deploy-runner/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "ecs_deploy_runner" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest module-ci release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-ci.git//modules/ecs-deploy-runner?ref=<VERSION>"

  name            = var.name
  container_image = var.container_image
  vpc_id          = var.vpc_id
  vpc_subnet_ids  = var.private_subnet_ids

  repository                          = var.repository
  ssh_private_key_secrets_manager_arn = var.ssh_private_key_secrets_manager_arn
}

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CREATE IAM POLICY WITH PERMISSIONS TO INVOKE THE ECS DEPLOY RUNNER VIA THE LAMBDA FUNCTION AND ATTACH TO USERS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

module "invoke_policy" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest module-ci release
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-ci.git//modules/ecs-deploy-runner-invoke-iam-policy?ref=<VERSION>"

  name                                      = "invoke-${var.name}"
  deploy_runner_invoker_lambda_function_arn = module.ecs_deploy_runner.invoker_function_arn
  deploy_runner_ecs_cluster_arn             = module.ecs_deploy_runner.ecs_cluster_arn
  deploy_runner_cloudwatch_log_group_name   = module.ecs_deploy_runner.cloudwatch_log_group_name
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "attach_invoke_to_roles" {
  for_each   = length(var.iam_roles) > 0 ? { for k in var.iam_roles : k => k } : {}
  role       = each.key
  policy_arn = module.invoke_policy.arn
}


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ATTACH FULL ACCESS PERMISSIONS TO REQUESTED SERVICES TO ECS TASK
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "full_access_to_services" {
  count  = length(var.permitted_services) > 0 ? 1 : 0
  name   = "full-access-to-services"
  role   = module.ecs_deploy_runner.ecs_task_iam_role_name
  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.full_access_to_services.json
}

data "aws_iam_policy_document" "full_access_to_services" {
  statement {
    actions   = formatlist("%s:*", var.permitted_services)
    resources = ["*"]
    effect    = "Allow"
  }
}
----

This module call does the following:

- Create an ECS cluster that can be used to run ECS Fargate tasks
- Deploy an ECS Task Definition for the provided container image with support for Fargate (`var.container_image`).
- Configure the ECS Task to expose the secrets in the Secrets Manager entry with the ARN
  `var.ssh_private_key_secrets_manager_arn` as environment variables.
- Deploy a Lambda function that is configured to invoke the ECS task to run on Fargate in the provided VPC and subnet
  (`var.vpc_id` and `var.private_subnet_ids`).
  Restrict the interface so that it can only be triggered to deploy code from the configured git repository
  (`var.repository`).
- Grant permissions to invoke the Invoker Lambda function to the given list of IAM users.
- Grant permissions to access the provided AWS services to the ECS Task.

Add the corresponding input variables to `variables.tf`:

.infrastructure-modules/cicd/ecs-deploy-runner/variables.tf
[source,hcl]
----
variable "vpc_id" {
  description = "ID of the VPC where the ECS task and Lambda function should run."
  type        = string
}

variable "private_subnet_ids" {
  description = "List of IDs of private subnets that can be used for running the ECS task and Lambda function."
  type        = list(string)
}

variable "container_image" {
  description = "Docker image (repo and tag) to use for the ECS task. Should contain the infrastructure-deploy-script for the pipeline to work. Refer to the Dockerfile in /modules/ecs-deploy-runner/docker/Dockerfile for a sample container you can use."
  type = object({
    repo = string
    tag  = string
  })
}

variable "repository" {
  description = "Git repository where source code is located."
  type        = string
}

variable "ssh_private_key_secrets_manager_arn" {
  description = "ARN of the AWS Secrets Manager entry to use for sourcing the SSH private key for cloning repositories. Set to null if you are only using public repos."
  type        = string
}

variable "name" {
  description = "Name of this instance of the deploy runner stack. Used to namespace all resources."
  type        = string
  default     = "ecs-deploy-runner"
}

variable "iam_roles" {
  description = "List of AWS IAM roles that should be given access to invoke the deploy runner."
  type        = list(string)
  default     = []
}

variable "permitted_services" {
  description = "A list of AWS services for which the Deploy Runner ECS Task will receive full permissions. For example, to grant the deploy runner access only to EC2 and Amazon Machine Learning, use the value [\"ec2\",\"machinelearning\"]."
  type        = list(string)
  default     = []
}
----

Since all the lookups for the ECS Deploy Runner can be done by name, it is not necessary for this module to expose any
outputs.

Once you test your code and the `ecs-deploy-runner` module is working the way you want, submit a
pull request, get your changes merged into the `master` branch, and create a new versioned release by using a Git tag.

Next, we will want to deploy the stack to the environments. Before deploying, we need to make sure we have a SSH key
pair we can use to access our private repositories:

. Create a machine user on your version control platform.

. Create a new SSH key pair on the command line using
`ssh-keygen`:
[source,bash]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "MACHINE_USER_EMAIL"
----
Make sure to set a different path to store the key (to avoid overwriting any existing key). Also avoid setting a
passphrase on the key.

. Upload the SSH key pair to the machine user. See the following docs for the major VCS platforms:
* https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account[GitHub]
* https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/README.html#adding-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account[GitLab]
* https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-an-ssh-key-728138079.html#SetupanSSHkey-#installpublickeyStep3.AddthepublickeytoyourBitbucketsettings[BitBucket] (Note: you will need to expand one of the instructions to see the full instructions for adding an SSH key to the machine user account)

. Create an AWS Secrets Manager entry with the contents of the private key. In the following example, we use the aws
CLI to create the entry in `us-east-2`, sourcing the contents from the SSH private key file `~/.ssh/machine_user`:
[source,bash]
----
cat ~/.ssh/machine_user \
    | xargs -0 aws secretsmanager create-secret --region us-east-2 --name "SSHPrivateKeyForECSDeployRunner" --secret-string
----
When you run this command, you should see a JSON output with metadata about the created secret:
[source,json]
----
{
    "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-2:000000000000:secret:SSHPrivateKeyForECSDeployRunner-SOME_RANDOM_STRING",
    "Name": "SSHPrivateKeyForECSDeployRunner",
    "VersionId": "21cda90e-84e0-4976-8914-7954cb6151bd"
}
----

Finally, head over to your `infrastructure-live` repo to deploy the stack to your environments. Add a new
`terragrunt.hcl` file that calls the module. We will use Terragrunt `dependency` blocks to get the outputs of our
dependencies to pass them to the module:

----
infrastructure-live
  └ production
    └ terragrunt.hcl
    └ us-east-2
      └ prod
        └ cicd
          └ ecr-repo
            └ terragrunt.hcl
          └ ecs-deploy-runner
            └ terragrunt.hcl
        └ networking
          └ vpc-mgmt
            └ terragrunt.hcl
----

.infrastructure-live/production/us-east-2/prod/cicd/ecs-deploy-runner/terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
# Pull in the backend and provider configurations from a root terragrunt.hcl file that you include in each child terragrunt.hcl:
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}

# Set the source to an immutable released version of the infrastructure module being deployed:
terraform {
  source = "git@github.com/<YOUR_ORG>/infrastructure-modules.git//cicd/ecr-repo?ref=v0.5.0"
}

# Look up the VPC and ECR repository information using dependency blocks:
dependency "vpc" {
  config_path = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../../networking/vpc-mgmt"
}
dependency "ecr" {
  config_path = "${get_terragrunt_dir()}/../ecr-repo"
}

# Configure input values for the specific environment being deployed:
inputs = {
  vpc_id             = dependency.vpc.outputs.vpc_id
  private_subnet_ids = dependency.vpc.outputs.vpc_id

  container_image = {
    repo = dependency.ecr.outputs.url
    tag  = "v1"
  }

  repository = "git@github.com:<YOUR_ORG>/infrastructure-live.git"

  # Set this to the Secrets Manager ARN that was outputted when you created the Secrets Manager entry.
  ssh_private_key_secrets_manager_arn = "ARN_TO_SECRETS_MANAGER_WITH_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY"

  # Set this to the AWS IAM role that your machine user will assume.
  iam_roles = ["allow-auto-deploy-from-other-accounts"]
  # This list should include all the services that you want this ECS deploy runner to manage.
  permitted_services = [
    "iam",
    "s3",
    "lambda",
    "apigateway",
    "dynamodb",
  ]
}
----

And run `terragrunt apply` to deploy the changes:

[source,bash]
----
cd infrastructure-live/production/us-east-2/prod/cicd/ecs-deploy-runner
terragrunt apply
----

Repeat for each environment that you want to support the ECS Deploy Runner stack.

=== Try out the ECS Deploy Runner

At this point, you can see if the ECS Deploy Runner can be used to deploy your infrastructure. To test, use the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci/tree/master/modules/infrastructure-deployer[infrastructure-deployer CLI].

To use the `infrastructure-deployer` CLI, use `gruntwork-install` to install a precompiled version for your system:

[source,bash]
----
# Update <VERSION> to the latest version of module-ci
gruntwork-install --binary-name "infrastructure-deployer" --repo "https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ci" --tag "<VERSION>"
----

Then, invoke the `infrastructure-deployer` against the `master` branch of your live infrastructure to run a `plan` on
the `vpc-mgmt` module (don't forget to assume the role):

[source,bash]
----
# NOTE: you should assume the IAM role allow-auto-deploy-from-other-accounts before running this step
infrastructure-deployer \
  --aws-region "us-east-2" \
  --ref "master" \
  --binary "terragrunt" \
  --command "plan" \
  --deploy-path "production/us-east-2/prod/networking/vpc-mgmt"
----

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a stream of logs that indicate a `terragrunt plan` running on the
`vpc-mgmt` module.


[[define_pipeline_as_code]]
=== Define pipeline as code

NOTE: This guide will use https://circleci.com/[CircleCI] as the CI server, but *it is NOT required for using the ECS
Deploy Runner stack*. You can configure any other CI server in a similar fashion to invoke deployments against the ECS
Deploy Runner.

Now that we have a working ECS Deploy Runner stack, the final step is to configure our CI/CD pipeline in our CI server
of choice. For this guide, we will configure CircleCI to implement the workflow described at the beginning of this
section.

Create the CircleCI configuration folder in your `infrastructure-live` repo:

----
infrastructure-live
  └ .circleci
    └ config.yml
    └ deploy.sh
    └ install.sh
  └ production
    └ terragrunt.hcl
    └ us-east-2
      └ prod
        └ cicd
          └ ecr-repo
            └ terragrunt.hcl
          └ ecs-deploy-runner
            └ terragrunt.hcl
        └ networking
          └ vpc-mgmt
            └ terragrunt.hcl
----

The scripts `deploy.sh` and `install.sh` are helper scripts to make the CircleCI configuration more readable. Here are
the contents of the scripts:

.infrastructure-live/.circleci/install.sh
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
#
# Script used by CircleCI to install the necessary helpers for the CI/CD pipeline

# - MODULE_CI_VERSION : The version of the module-ci repository to use when installing the terraform helpers and
#                       infrastructure-deployer CLI.
# - MODULE_SECURITY_VERSION : The version of the module-security repository to use when installing the aws-auth utility.

We will call out to these scripts in the CI pipeline to setup our environment for the deployments. With the scripts
defined, let's start building out our CircleCI config. We will start by defining the workflows, which acts as the basis
of our pipeline:

.infrastructure-live/.circleci/config.yml
[source,yaml]
----
version: 2.1

workflows:
  continuous-deploy:
    jobs:
      - plan

      - notify:
          requires:
            - plan
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master

      - hold:
          type: approval
          requires:
            - notify
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master

      - deploy:
          requires:
            - hold
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master
----

Our workflow consists of four steps:

- `plan`: Run `terragrunt plan` on all the files that changed. This is run on commits to all branches.
- `notify`: Notify on slack that there is an approval available for review. This should only run on `master` (our
            deployment branch). The rest of the pipeline will also only be restricted to commits on `master`.
- `hold`: The approval stage. We will hold all deployments for approval after running plan, but before proceeding to
          running `terragrunt apply` so that an admin has a chance to review the exact changes that are about to be
          rolled out.
- `deploy`: Run `terragrunt apply` on all the files that changed. This should only happen after approval.

Next, we will update our config to start defining the jobs. Since all the jobs will have common elements, we will
define a few aliases in the config to reuse common components.

The first is the runtime environment of each job:

.infrastructure-live/.circleci/config.yml
[source,yaml]
----
# Global constants for the jobs. This includes:
# - Using machine executor
# - Tools versions
defaults: &defaults
  machine:
    image: "ubuntu-1604:201903-01"
  environment:
    GRUNTWORK_INSTALLER_VERSION: v0.0.22
    MODULE_CI_VERSION: v0.17.0
    MODULE_SECURITY_VERSION: v0.24.1
    REGION: us-east-2
----

We will also want to figure out a friendly name for the deployment. CircleCI gives us a few environment variables that
are related to the commit that has triggered the build, but for notification purposes we would like to know whether the
build is a tag, branch, or SHA. The following routine updates the runtime with the environment variable
`CIRCLE_FRIENDLY_REF` which tells us whether the change was a tag, branch, or bare commit:

.infrastructure-live/.circleci/config.yml
[source,yaml]
----
# This common step is used to determine the user friendly Git Ref name of the build, either the branch or tag.
set_friendly_git_ref: &set_friendly_git_ref
  run:
    name: set friendly git ref name
    command: |
      if [[ ! -z "$CIRCLE_TAG" ]]; then
        echo 'export CIRCLE_FRIENDLY_REF="$CIRCLE_TAG"' >> $BASH_ENV
      elif [[ ! -z "$CIRCLE_BRANCH" ]]; then
        echo 'export CIRCLE_FRIENDLY_REF="$CIRCLE_BRANCH"' >> $BASH_ENV
      else
        echo 'export CIRCLE_FRIENDLY_REF="$CIRCLE_SHA1"' >> $BASH_ENV
      fi
----

We also need to know what the base comparison point is for finding updated modules. We will set this as the environment
variable `SOURCE_REF` in the runtime environment:

.infrastructure-live/.circleci/config.yml
[source,yaml]
----
# This is used to determine what to use as the base comparison point for determining what modules to deploy. The logic
# is as follows:
#   - If we are on the master branch, the comparison is only the current commit.
#   - If we are not on master, the comparison is to the current state of the master branch.
set_source_ref: &set_source_ref
  run:
    name: set source ref
    command: |
      if [[ "$CIRCLE_BRANCH" == "master" ]]; then
        echo 'export SOURCE_REF=HEAD^' >> $BASH_ENV
      else
        # We have to use origin/master because the checkout routine in CircleCI sets the local master to HEAD.
        echo 'export SOURCE_REF=origin/master' >> $BASH_ENV
      fi
----

Finally, we need to import functionality to notify on Slack. We will use the
https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/slack-orb[official Slack Orb] from CircleCI:

.infrastructure-live/.circleci/config.yml
[source,yaml]
----
orbs:
  slack: circleci/slack@3.4.2
----

Once we have the common elements defined as aliases, we can start defining each of the jobs. We will start with the
`plan` job:

.infrastructure-live/.circleci/config.yml
[source,yaml]
----
  plan:
    <<: *defaults
    steps:
      - <<: *set_friendly_git_ref
      - <<: *set_source_ref
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: install utilities
          command: ./.circleci/install.sh
      - run:
          name: run plan
          command: ./.circleci/deploy.sh plan
      - slack/status:
          channel: workflow-approvals
          success_message: "PLAN from $CIRCLE_FRIENDLY_REF ($CIRCLE_SHA1) successful. Click 'Visit Job' to see output."
          failure_message: "PLAN from $CIRCLE_FRIENDLY_REF ($CIRCLE_SHA1) failed. Click 'Visit Job' to see output."
----

This job will do the following:

- Set common environment variables for knowing a friendly name for the git ref that triggered the change and the source
  ref for the changes.
- Checkout the code in the repository.
- Call `install.sh` which will install gruntwork utilities necessary for invoking a deployment.
- Call `deploy.sh` which will use the `git-updated-folders` and `infrastructure-deployer` utilities to run plan on the
  updated modules.
- Notify in the `workflow-approvals` slack channel whether the plan was successful or had failed.

Next, we will define the `deploy` job, which will closely resemble the `plan` job:

.infrastructure-live/.circleci/config.yml
[source,yaml]
----
  deploy:
    <<: *defaults
    steps:
      - <<: *set_friendly_git_ref
      - <<: *set_source_ref
      - slack/notify:
          channel: workflow-approvals
          message: "A deployment was approved by $CIRCLE_USERNAME for $CIRCLE_FRIENDLY_REF ($CIRCLE_SHA1). Click 'Visit Job' to see output."
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: install utilities
          command: ./.circleci/install.sh
      - run:
          name: run apply
          command: ./.circleci/deploy.sh apply
      - slack/status:
          channel: workflow-approvals
          success_message: "APPLY from $CIRCLE_FRIENDLY_REF ($CIRCLE_SHA1) was successful. Click 'Visit Job' to see output."
          failure_message: "APPLY from $CIRCLE_FRIENDLY_REF ($CIRCLE_SHA1) failed. Click 'Visit Job' to see output."
----

This is very similar to the `plan` job, with two differences:

- Before invoking the deployment, send a message to the `workflow-approvals` slack channel indicating that a deployment
  had started in response to an approval event.
- Call `apply` instead of `plan`.

Finally, we define the jobs for the approval notifications:

.infrastructure-live/.circleci/config.yml
[source,yaml]
----
  notify:
    <<: *defaults
    steps:
      - <<: *set_friendly_git_ref
      - slack/approval:
          channel: workflow-approvals
          message: "A deployment for $CIRCLE_FRIENDLY_REF ($CIRCLE_SHA1) is pending approval. Click 'Visit Workflow' to approve."
----

This job will send a message to the `workflow-approvals` slack channel that there is a deployment that is pending
approval.

For convenience, here is the full configuration in its entirety, with a few components reorganized for readability:

.infrastructure-live/.circleci/config.yml
[source,yaml]

  continuous-deploy:
    jobs:
      - plan

      - notify:

            branches:
              only: master

      - hold:
          type: approval
          requires:
            - notify
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master

      - deploy:
          requires:

[[configure_ci_server]]
=== Configure CI Server

Once we have our pipeline defined as code in our repository, we can hook it up to our CI server to start building.
Configure CircleCI to start building the `infrastructure-live` repo by adding the project to your org.

To add the `infrastructure-live` repo:

- Login to CircleCI as **the machine user**. If you don't have an account for the machine user, sign up using the GitHub
  account of the machine user.
- Go to the projects page for your org and click the **Add Projects** button.
- Look for the `infrastructure-live` repo in the list, and click the **Set Up Project** button next to the repo.
- Click the **Start Building** button to trigger the first build. Note that this build is expected to fail since we
  haven't configured the required environment variables.

Next, we need to configure the environment variables for the build:

- Click the gear icon in the top right for the job to configure the job.
- Add a **User Key** in the **Checkout SSH keys** settings for the build.
- Click **Environment Variables** and add the following variables to the build:
    - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: The AWS access key pair for the machine user to access your AWS
      account. This should be a user in the security account with the ability to assume the auto deploy role in each of
      the environments that you wish to configure CI/CD for.
    - `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN`: A personal access token for the machine user with access to Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code
      Library.
    - `SLACK_WEBHOOK`: A webhook for posting messages to your Slack org. You can refer to
      https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks[the official Slack documentation] for instructions on how to configure a
      webhook for your Slack org.

Once you have these configurations set, you should be able to start deploying your infrastructure in reaction to git
events!


== Next steps

Now that you have a CI/CD pipeline for your infrastructure code, test it out by doing one of the following;

- Add a new component to `infrastructure-live` and see how it flows through the pipeline.
- Make a change to one of the existing components that you have already deployed and see how it flows through the
  pipeline.
