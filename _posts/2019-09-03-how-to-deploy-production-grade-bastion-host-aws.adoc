== Intro

This guide will walk you through the process of configuring a production-grade Kubernetes cluster on AWS.

=== What is Kubernetes?

<<deployment_walkthrough>>::
  A step-by-step guide to deploying a Kubernetes cluster in AWS that you can rely on in production. To get a
  sense of what production-grade means, check out <<production_grade_infra_checklist>>.
<<next_steps>>::
  What to do once you've got your Kubernetes cluster deployed.

Feel free to read the guide from start to finish or skip around to whatever part interests you!

Let's now walk through how to deploy a production-grade Kubernetes cluster, fully defined and managed as code, using
the Gruntwork Service Catalog.

[[pre_requisites]]
=== Pre-requisites

This walkthrough has the following pre-requistes:

Gruntwork Service Catalog::
  This guide uses code from the https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Service Catalog], as it
  implements most of the production-grade design for you out of the box.
+
IMPORTANT: You must be a https://gruntwork.io/[Gruntwork subscriber] to access this code.
+
Make sure to read <<how_to_use_gruntwork_service_catalog>>.

Terraform::
  This guide uses https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform] to define and manage all the infrastructure as code. If you're
  not familiar with Terraform, check out https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-terraform-b3d32832baca[A
  Comprehensive Guide to Terraform], https://training.gruntwork.io/p/terraform[A Crash Course on Terraform], and
  <<how_to_use_gruntwork_service_catalog>>.

AWS accounts::
  This guide deploys infrastructure into one or more AWS accounts. Check out the
  <<production_grade_aws_account_structure>> guide for instructions. You will also need to be able to authenticate to
  these accounts on the CLI: check out
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-authenticating-to-aws-on-the-command-line-63656a686799[A Comprehensive Guide to Authenticating to AWS on the Command Line]
  for instructions.
