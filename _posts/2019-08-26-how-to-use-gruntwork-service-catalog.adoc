== Intro

This guide will walk you through how to use the
https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Service Catalog] to build a production-grade tech stack
for your company.

=== What is the Gruntwork Service Catalog and Reference Architecture?

The https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Service Catalog] is a collection of over 300,000
lines of reusable, battle-tested, production-ready infrastructure code for AWS and GCP. Here are the benefits of using
the Gruntwork Service Catalog:

// TODO: add a screenshot of the service catalog

Go to prod in days, not months::
  Most teams have the same basic infrastructure needs (e.g., Docker cluster, load balancer, database, cache, CI/CD,
  monitoring, secrets management, and so on), so instead of wasting months reinventing the wheel and building these
  same pieces from scratch, you get to leverage a library of reusable, battle-tested, off-the-shelf infrastructure
  that has been built by a team of DevOps experts and proven in production at hundreds of companies.

Customize everything using infrastructure as code::
  Everything in the Gruntwork Service Catalog is defined as code (primarily in Terraform, Go, Python, and Bash) and
  you get access to 100% of this code. You can combine and compose this code in any way you wish, see how everything
  works under the hood, debug any issues you run into, and customize and modify the code to fit your exact needs.

Learn best practices::
  The Service Catalog includes both thorough documentation and access to the
  https://gruntwork.io/training/[DevOps Training Library], a collection of video training courses that teach a variety
  of DevOps topics, such as infrastructure as code, Terraform, Docker, Packer, AWS, GCP, security, and more.

Keep everything up to date::
  All of the code in the Gruntwork Service Catalog is semantically versioned and we are constantly releasing new
  versions with the latest best practices, new features, and bug fixes. Never miss a critical security fix again. Never
  waste months updating to the latest version of Terraform. Just follow the instructions in the monthly
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter[Gruntwork Newsletter] to get better infrastructure through a
  version number bump.

Get commercial support::
  Get access to a team of DevOps experts who can help you set up your infrastructure, design highly available and
  scalable systems, automate your builds and deployments, troubleshoot issues, and avoid gotchas and pitfalls. Reach out
  to us via Slack, email, and phone/video calls, get code reviews, prioritized bug fixes, and SLAs on response times.

[[core_concepts]]
== Core concepts

=== The Gruntwork Service Catalog

// TODO: add a screenshot of the service catalog

The Gruntwork Service Catalog is a collection of over 300,000 lines of reusable, battle-tested infrastructure code.
that is organized into 40+ GitHub repos, some public and open source, and some private and only accessible to Gruntwork
customers. Each repo is focused on one type of infrastructure: e.g., there is one repo that contains code for deploying
and managing Kubernetes on AWS, one repo with code for deploying and managing the ELK stack, one repo that
contains a collection of CI / CD code, and so on.

The code in the Gruntwork Service Catalog is written using a combination of:

Terraform::
  Used to to define and manage most of the basic infrastructure, such as servers, databases, load balancers, and
  networking. More on <<terraform>> later.

Bash::
  Used for _install scripts_ (e.g., a Bash script that you can use to create Linux VM image with Elasticsearch
  installed) and _run scripts_ (e.g., you use Terraform to deploy a cluster of server with the Elasticsearch VM image
  on it and configure the servers to execute a Bash script during boot that can auto-discover and bootstrap the
  Elasticsearch cluster).

Python::
  Used for more complicated scripts, especially those that need to run on other operating systems (e.g., Windows)
  and/or those that need to be called directly from Terraform (e.g., to fill in some missing functionality).

Go::
  Used to build complex, cross-platform CLI applications. E.g., We have an app called `ssh-grunt` you can run on each
  server to manage SSH access to that server via IAM groups.

Why these languages? We wrote an entire blog post on
https://blog.gruntwork.io/why-we-use-terraform-and-not-chef-puppet-ansible-saltstack-or-cloudformation-7989dad2865c[why we use Terraform];
as for Bash, Python, and Go, we use them because they work just about everywhere, with few or no external dependencies,
and they can be integrated with almost any configuration management tool: e.g., you can use Bash scripts with Chef,
Puppet, Ansible, Packer, and Docker (more on <<packer>> and <<docker>> later).

The code in each repo is organized into three primary folders, `modules`, `examples`, and `test`, as described in the
following sections.

=== Modules

// TODO: add a screenshot of the modules folder

Each repo in the Gruntwork Service Catalog contains a `modules` folder that contains the main implementation code,
broken down into standalone, orthogonal, reusable, highly configurable _modules_. For example, the ELK repo
(Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kubernetes) isn't one giant module that deploys the entire ELK stack, but a bunch of separate
modules for installing, running, and deploying Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, Elastalert, Beats, Collectd, and so on.

This allows you to combine and compose the modules in many different permutations to fit your exact needs: e.g., some
use cases need the full ELK stack, while some solely use Elasticsearch; sometimes you run Elasticsearch, Logstash, and
Kibana each in completely separate clusters (e.g., in prod, for high availability and scalability) and sometimes you
run them all in a single cluster or single node (e.g., in dev, to save money).

=== Examples

// TODO: add a screenshot of some example code

Each repo in the Gruntwork Service Catalog contains an `examples` folder that shows you how to assemble the modules
from the `modules` folder into different permutations. This lets you try the modules out in minutes, without having to
write a line of code. In other words, this is executable documentation.

=== Automated tests

// TODO: add a screenshot of some test code

Each repo in the Gruntwork Service Catalog contains a `test` folder that contains automated tests for the examples in
the `examples` folder. These are mostly integration tests, which use
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/[Terratest] under the hood to deploy the examples into real environments
(e.g., real AWS and GCP accounts), validate that everything works, and then tear everything down.

For example, after every commit to the ELK repo, we spin up a dozen ELK clusters, perform a variety of validation steps
(e.g., read data, write data, access Kibana, etc.) and then tear it all down again. This is how we build confidence
that the code does what we say it doesâ€”and that it continues to do it over years of updates.

=== Versioning

All of the code in the Gruntwork Service Catalog is _versioned_. Every time we make a change, we put out a new
versioned release, and announce it in the monthly
https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter[Gruntwork Newsletter].

When you use the code from the Gruntwork Service Catalog (a topic we'll cover in <<how_to_use_the_catalog>>), you will
always pin yourself to a specific version of the code. That way, you are not accidentally affected by any subsequent
changes in the Gruntwork Service Catalog until you explicitly choose to pull those changes in. And when you do want to
pull the changes in, it's just a matter of bumping the version number!

We use version numbers of the form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.2.3`), following the principles of
_https://semver.org[semantic versioning]_. In traditional semantic versioning, you increment the:

. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

However, much of the Gruntwork Service Catalog is built on Terraform, and as Terraform is still not at version `1.0.0`
(latest version as of August, 2019, was `0.12.6`), most of the Gruntwork Service Catalog is using `0.MINOR.PATCH`
version numbers. With `0.MINOR.PATCH`, the rules are a bit different, where you increment the:

. MINOR version when you make incompatible API changes
. PATCH version when you add backwards compatible functionality or bug fixes.

=== The Gruntwork Reference Architecture

// TODO: Ref Arch diagram

The https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/[Gruntwork Reference Architecture] is a production-grade, end-to-end
tech stack built on top of the modules from the Gruntwork Service Catalog.

What it includes::
  The Reference Architecture includes just about everything the typical company needs: multiple environments, each
  configured with server orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), load balancers, databases, caches, network topology,
  monitoring, alerting, log aggregation, CI/CD, user management, secrets management, SSH management, VPN management, and
  much more (for a detailed walkthrough, see
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-build-an-end-to-end-production-grade-architecture-on-aws-part-1-eae8eeb41fec[How to Build an End to End Production-Grade Architecture on AWS]).
  We wire all these pieces together according to your needs, deploy it into your AWS or GCP accounts, and give you
  100% of the codeâ€”all in about one day.

Opinionated code::
  Whereas the Gruntwork Service Catalog is relatively unopinionated, allowing you to combine and compose modules, tools,
  and approaches however you want ("a la carte"), the Gruntwork Reference Architecture is more opinionated, giving you a
  small set of pre-defined, standardized sets of modules, tools, and approaches to choose from ("prixe fixe"). If the
  opinionated design of the Reference Architecture looks like a good fit for your company, you may wish to purchase it
  as a way to save months on having to wire everything together and deploy it yourself. If the opinionated design is
  not a good fit, then you will want to use the Gruntwork Service Catalog directly instead.

[[example_ref_arch]]
See an example Reference Architecture::
  You can find the code for an example Reference Architecture for a fictional Acme corporation in the following repos:

* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-live-multi-account-acme/tree/master/_docs[Walkthrough documentation]
  (start here!): The Reference Architecture comes with end-to-end documentation that walks you through all of the code
  so you know how to run things in dev, how to deploy changes to prod, how to find metrics and logs, how to connect
  over VPN and SSH, and so on. This is a great starting point for exploring the Reference Architecture.

* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-modules-multi-account-acme[infrastratructure-modules]: In this repo,
  you'll find the reusable modules that define the infrastructure for the entire company (in this case, for Acme).
  These are like the blueprints for a house.
* https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-modules-multi-account-acme[infrastratructure-live]: This repo uses
  the modules from `infrastructure-modules` to deploy all of the live environments for the company (dev, stage, prod,

  sample app that demonstrates best practices for a Docker-based frontend app or microservice, including examples of
  how to talk to backend apps (i.e., service discovery), manage secrets, use TLS certs, and render HTML and JSON. This
  app is written in Node.js but the underlying patterns apply to any language or technology.

[[production_grade_infra_checklist]]
=== The production-grade infrastructure checklist

The Gruntwork Service Catalog is a collection of _production-grade infrastructure_â€”that is, the type of reliable,
secure, battle-tested infrastructure that you'd bet your company on. Every time you deploy infrastructure, you're
betting that your infrastructure wonâ€™t fall over if traffic goes up; you're betting that your infrastructure won't lose
your data if there's an outage; you're betting that your infrastructure won't allow your data to be compromised when
hackers try to break in; and if these bets don't work out, your company may go out of business. That's what's at stake
when we say "production-grade."

Building production-grade infrastructure requires taking into account a long list of details, which we have captured in
_The Production-Grade Infrastructure Checklist_:

|===

Most other collections of infrastructure code and service catalogs (e.g., AWS Quick Starts, Bitnami Application Catalog,
the Terraform Registry, Ansible Galaxy, Chef Supermarket, etc) are useful for learning and example code, but they do
not take most of this checklist into account, and therefore are not a good fit for direct production use. On the other
hand, every module in the Gruntwork Service Catalog goes through the production-grade checklist and is explicitly
designed for use directly in production.

=== Infrastructure as code

Everything in the Gruntwork Service Catalog is designed to allow you to define your _infrastructure as code (IaC)_.
That is, instead of deploying infrastructure _manually_ (e.g., by clicking around a web page), the idea behind IaC is
to write code to define, provision, and manage your infrastructure. This has a number of benefits:

Self-service::
  Most teams that deploy code manually have a small number of sysadmins (often, just one) who are the only ones who
  know all the magic incantations to make the deployment work and are the only ones with access to production. This
  becomes a major bottleneck as the company grows. If your infrastructure is defined in code, then the entire
  deployment process can be automated, and developers can kick off their own deployments whenever necessary.

Speed and safety::
  If the deployment process is automated, it'll be significantly faster, since a computer can carry out the deployment
  steps far faster than a person; and safer, since an automated process will be more consistent, more repeatable, and
  not prone to manual error.

Documentation::
  Instead of the state of your infrastructure being locked away in a single sysadmin's head, you can represent the
  state of your infrastructure in source files that anyone can read. In other words, IaC acts as documentation,
  allowing everyone in the organization to understand how things work, even if the sysadmin goes on vacation.

Version control::
  You can store your IaC source files in version control, which means the entire history of your infrastructure is now
  captured in the commit log. This becomes a powerful tool for debugging issues, as any time a problem pops up, your
  first step will be to check the commit log and find out what changed in your infrastructure, and your second step may
  be to resolve the problem by simply reverting back to a previous, known-good version of your IaC code.

Validation::
  If the state of your infrastructure is defined in code, then for every single change, you can perform a code review,
  run a suite of automated tests, and pass the code through static analysis tools, all practices that are known to
  significantly reduce the chance of defects.

Happiness::
  Deploying code and managing infrastructure manually is repetitive and tedious. Developers and sysadmins resent this
  type of work, as it involves no creativity, no challenge, and no recognition. You could deploy code perfectly for
  months, and no one will take noticeâ€”until that one day when you mess it up. That creates a stressful and unpleasant
  environment. IaC offers a better alternative that allows computers to do what they do best (automation) and
  developers to do what they do best (coding).

Reuse::
  You can package your infrastructure into reusable modules, so that instead of doing every deployment for every
  product in every environment from scratch, you can build on top of known, documented, battle-tested pieces. You
  can build these reusable modules yourself or use an existing collection of modules, such as the Gruntwork Service
  Catalog.

Some of the main IaC tools you'll see used and referenced in the Gruntwork Service Catalog are Terraform, Terragrunt,
Packer, and Docker, each of which we'll discuss in the next several sections.

[[terraform]]
=== Terraform

https://www.terraform.io[Terraform] is an open source _provisioning_ tool that allows you to define and manage as code a
wide variety of infrastructure (e.g., servers, load balancers, databases, network settings, and so on) across
a wide variety of _providers_ (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure). For example, here's some example Terraform code you can use to
deploy an EC2 instance (a virtual server) running Ubuntu 18.04 into the `us-east-2` region of AWS:

.terraform-example.tf
[source,hcl]
----
# Deploy to the us-east-2 region of AWS
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-2"
}

# Deploy an EC2 instance running Ubuntu 18.04
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
----

You can deploy this server by running `terraform init` and `terraform apply`. Check out the
https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-terraform-b3d32832baca[Comprehensive Guide to Terraform] for a
thorough introduction to the language.

A large percentage of the infrastructure code in the Gruntwork Service Catalog is defined using Terraform. We even
wrote https://www.terraformupandrunning.com[the book] on it!

=== Terragrunt

https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt[Terragrunt] is a thin, open source wrapper for Terraform. It is designed to
fill in some missing features in Terraform, such as allowing you to define your Terraform backend configuration in
one `terragrunt.hcl` file, rather than having to copy/paste the same config over and over again:

.terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
remote_state {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state"
    key            = "${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "my-lock-table"
  }
}
----

Check out
https://blog.gruntwork.io/terragrunt-how-to-keep-your-terraform-code-dry-and-maintainable-f61ae06959d8[Terragrunt: how to keep your Terraform code DRY and maintainable]
for a thorough introduction.

Note that while the Gruntwork Reference Architecture relies on Terragrunt as one of its opinionated tools, the
Gruntwork Service Catalog does NOT require Terragrunt; you can use the Terraform modules in the Gruntwork
Service Catalog with vanilla Terraform, Terraform Enterprise, Atlantis, Terragrunt, or any other tools you prefer.

[[packer]]
=== Packer

https://www.packer.io[https://www.packer.io] is an open source tool you can use to define _machine images_ (e.g., VM
images, Docker images) as code. For example, here is how you can use Packer to define an Ubuntu 18.04 Amazon Machine
Image (AMI) that has Node.js installed:

.packer-example.json
[source,json]
----
{
  "builders": [{
    "type": "amazon-ebs",
    "region": "us-east-2",
    "source_ami": "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0",
    "instance_type": "t2.micro",
    "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
    "ami_name": "packer-example-{{timestamp}}"
  }],
  "provisioners": [{
    "type": "shell",
    "inline": [
      "curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -",
      "sudo apt-get update -y",
      "sudo apt-get install -y nodejs"
    ]
  }]
}
----

You can run `packer build packer-example.json` to build an AMI from this code and then deploy this AMI to your AWS
account using other tools. For example, the Gruntwork Service Catalog contains several Terraform modules that can
deploy AMIs across one or more servers (e.g., into an AWS Auto Scaling Group), with support for auto scaling, auto
healing, zero-downtime deployments, etc.

The Gruntwork Service Catalog contains a number of scripts and binaries that you can run on your servers: e.g., the
ELK code includes scripts you run during boot on Elasticsearch servers to bootstrap the cluster; you can also run
the `ssh-grunt` binary on each server to allow manage SSH access to that server using IAM groups (i.e., IAM users in
specific IAM groups will be able to SSH to specific servers using their own usernames and SSH keys).

To get these scripts and binaries onto your virtual servers (e.g., onto EC2 instances in AWS or compute instances in
GCP), we recommend using Packer to build VM images that have these scripts and binaries installed. You'll see an
example of how to do this in <<how_to_use_the_catalog>>. Note that Gruntwork Service Catalog does NOT require that
you use Packer (e.g., you could also use Ansible or Chef to install the scripts and binaries), but the Gruntwork
Reference Architecture does use Packer as one of its opinionated tools.

[[docker]]
=== Docker

https://www.docker.com[Docker] is an open source tool you can use to run _containers_ and define _container images_ as
code. A container is a bit like a lightweight VM, except instead of virtualizing all the hardware and OS, containers
virtualize solely user space, which gives you many of the isolation benefits of a VM (e.g., each container is isolated
in terms of memory, CPU, networking, hard drive, etc), but with much less memory, CPU, and start-up time overhead.
For example, here is how you can define an Ubuntu 18.04 Docker image that has Node.js installed:

.packer-example.json
[source,Dockerfile]
----
FROM ubuntu:18.04

RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash - && \
    sudo apt-get update -y && \
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
----

You can run `docker build -t example-image .` to build a Docker image from this code and then deploy the Docker image
using a _container orchestration tool_ such as Kubernetes, ECS, nor Nomad (all of these tools are available in the
Gruntwork Service Catalog).

[[immutable_infrastructure]]
=== Immutable infrastructure

With _mutable infrastructure_, you deploy a set of servers, and you continuously update those servers in place. Every
new update gets installed on top of the previous updates, either manually (e.g., by SSHing to each server and running
commands), or via tools like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet. Over time, each "mutable" server builds up a history of
changes, which can make it difficult to (a) reason about what's actually installed and (b) debug issues that are
specific to the unique history of one server but not others.

The idea behind _immutable infrastructure_ is that once you deploy a server, you never change it again. If you need to
roll out an update, you deploy a _new_ server with that update, and undeploy the old one. This paradigm is built for use
with (a) the cloud, where you can easily spin up or tear down servers on-demand and (b) machine images, as every time
there's a change, you can use tools like Packer or Docker to build a new, immutable, versioned machine image (e.g., VM
image or Docker image), and deploy new servers with that image.

The advantages of immutable infrastructure are:

Easier to reason about servers::
  It's much easier to figure out what's installed on any server, as you know the exact image each server is running,
  and that the image never changes.

You can run the same images in all environments::
  For example, you can run the same Docker image on your laptop and in production (whereas it's rare to run Ansbile,
  Chef, or Puppet in local dev). This helps to reduce "works on my machine" and environment-specific bugs, and makes it
  easier to debug those issues when they do happen.

Easier scaling and rollback::
  With immutable images, you can quickly and easily spin up 100 or 1,000 servers, with no need to worry about how long
  it'll take to configure all those servers (e.g., via Ansible, Chef, or Puppet), as all the configuration has already
  happened and is captured in the VM or Docker image. Rollback is easier too, as you can quickly jump back to a
  previous image, without having to wait for and worry about running a bunch of older install commands (which may no
  longer work, e.g., if certain packages have been removed from APT or YUM).

=== Operating system compatibility

TODO

[[how_to_use_the_catalog]]
== How to use the Gruntwork Service Catalog

With all the core concepts out of the way, let's now discuss how to use the Gruntwork Service Catalog to build
production-grade infrastructure.

=== Learning resources

The first step is to learn! You'll need to learn about your chosen cloud (e.g., AWS or GCP), infrastructure (e.g., VPCs,
Kubernetes, Kafka, ELK), tools (e.g., Terraform, Docker, Packer), and DevOps practices (e.g., CI, CD). Here are some
useful resources:

. https://gruntwork.io/training/[Gruntwork DevOps Training Library]: a collection of video training courses that teach
  a variety of DevOps topics, such as infrastructure as code, Terraform, Docker, Packer, AWS, GCP, security, and more.
. https://gruntwork.io/guides/[Gruntwork Production Deployment Guides]: a collection of guides that do step-by-step
  walkthroughs of how to go to production. You're reading one now!
. https://gruntwork.io/devops-resources/[Gruntwork DevOps Resources]: a collection of blog posts, talks, books, and
  checklists for learning about DevOps, AWS, Terraform, Docker, Packer, and more.

[[get_access]]
=== Get access to the Gruntwork Service Catalog

The next step is to get access to the Gruntwork Service Catalog.

. To get access, you must become a https://gruntwork.io[Gruntwork subscriber].
. As part of the sign up process, we'll ask for your GitHub user ID. The Gruntwork Service Catalog lives in 40+ GitHub
  repos, most of them private, so you'll need to send us a GitHub user ID so we can grant you access (if you don't
  already have a GitHub user, you can create one for free on http://github.com/[github.com]).
. If you haven't already, create an SSH key, add it to `ssh-agent`, and associate it with your GitHub user
  (https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent[instructions]).
  You'll need a working SSH key to access Terraform modules in the Gruntwork Service Catalog (you'll see examples of
  this later in the guide).
. If you haven't already, create a GitHub personal access token
  (https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line[instructions]). You'll
  need a working GitHub personal access token to access scripts and binaries in the Gruntwork Service Catalog (you'll
  see examples of this later in the guide).

=== Find the modules you want to use

The next step is to find the modules you want to use. Head over to the
https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Service Catalog] and find the repos that you wish to
use. Browse the `modules` folder each the repo to see what modules are available and the `examples` folders to see the
various ways to combine those modules. You can also browse the <<example_ref_arch>> to find production-ready sample
code to use as examples.

Within the Service Catalog, you'll find two types of modules: (1) Terraform modules and (2) scripts and binaries. The
next two sections of the guide will walk you through how to use each of these.

=== Using Terraform Modules

This section will show you how to use Terraform modules from the Gruntwork Service Catalog. As an illustrative example,
we'll deploy the `vpc-app`  Terraform module from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc[module-vpc].

IMPORTANT: You must be a https://gruntwork.io/[Gruntwork subscriber] to access `module-vpc`.

You can use this module to deploy a production-grade VPC on AWS. For full background information on VPCs, check
out <<production_grade_vpc_aws>>.

==== Create a wrapper module

The Terraform modules in the Gruntwork Service Catalog are intentionally designed to be unopinionated, so they do not
configure `provider` or `backend` settings. Moreover, you will typically use a couple of the modules from the Service
Catalog together, rather than just one at a time. Therefore, to use a Terraform module from the Gruntwork Service
Catalog, you'll need to create a _wrapper module_ in one of your own Git repos.

Let's assume you have a repo called `infrastructure-modules` and create a `vpc-app` wrapper modules in it:

----
infrastructure-modules
  â”” networking
    â”” vpc-app
      â”” main.tf
      â”” outputs.tf
      â”” variables.tf
----

==== Configure your providers

Inside of `main.tf`, configure whatever Terraform providers you're using. Since the `vpc-app` and `vpc-app-network-acls`
modules we're using in this guide are AWS modules, you'll need to configure the AWS provider:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
provider "aws" {
  # The AWS region in which all resources will be created
  region = var.aws_region

  # Require a 2.x version of the AWS provider
  version = "~> 2.6"

  # Only these AWS Account IDs may be operated on by this template
  allowed_account_ids = var.aws_account_id
}
----

This configures the AWS provider as follows:

Use a specific AWS region::
  The AWS region is configured via the `aws_region` input variable (you'll declare this shortly). This allows you to
  deploy this module in multiple regions.

Pin the AWS provider version::
  The code above ensures that you always get AWS provider version `2.x` and won't accidentally get version `3.x` in the
  future, which would be backwards incompatible. We recommend pinning the versions for all providers you're using.

Pin AWS account IDs::
  The code above will only allow you to run it against the AWS account with ID passed in via the `aws_account_id` input
  variable (you'll declare this shortly). This is an extra safety measure to ensure you don't accidentally authenticate
  to the wrong AWS account while deploying this codeâ€”e.g., so you don't accidentally deploy changes intended for
  staging to production (for more info on working with multiple AWS accounts, see
  <<production_grade_aws_account_structure>>).

Let's add the corresponding input variables in `variables.tf`:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/variables.tf
[source,hcl]
----
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "The AWS region in which all resources will be created"
  type        = string
}

variable "aws_account_id" {
  description = "The ID of the AWS Account in which to create resources."
  type        = string
}
----

==== Configure Terraform

Next, configure Terraform itself in `main.tf`:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
terraform {
  # Partial configuration for the backend: https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/config.html#partial-configuration
  backend "s3" {}

  # Only allow this Terraform version. Note that if you upgrade to a newer version, Terraform won't allow you to use an
  # older version, so when you upgrade, you should upgrade everyone on your team and your CI servers all at once.
  required_version = "= 0.12.6"
}
----

This configures Terraform as follows:

Configure a backend::
  The code above configures a _backend_, which is a shared location where Terraform state can be stored and accessed by
  your team. You can use any of the https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/index.html[supported backends] (the
  example above uses S3, which is a good choice for AWS users). See
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-manage-terraform-state-28f5697e68fa[How to manage Terraform state] for more info.

Partial configuration::
  The backend uses a _https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/config.html#partial-configuration[partial configuration],
  which means most of the backend configuration (e.g., which S3 bucket and path to use) will be specified from outside
  of the code. You'll see an example of this soon.

Pin the Terraform version::
  The code above will ONLY allow you to run it with a specific Terraform version. This is a safety measure to ensure
  you don't accidentally pick up a new version of Terraform until you're ready. This is important because (a) Terraform
  is a pre 1.0.0 tool, so even patch version number bumps (e.g., `0.12.6` -> `0.12.7`) are sometimes backwards
  incompatible or buggy and (b) once you've upgraded to a newer version, Terraform will no longer allow you to deploy
  that code with any older version. For example, if a single person on your team upgrades to `0.12.7` and runs `apply`,
  then you'll no longer be able to use the state file with `0.12.6`, and you'll be forced to upgrade everyone on your
  team and all your CI servers to `0.12.7`. It's best to do this explicitly, rather than accidentally, so we recommend
  pinning Terraform versions.

==== Use the modules from the Gruntwork Service Catalog

Now you can pull in the Terraform modules you want from the Gruntwork Service Catalog as follows:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "vpc" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest module-vpc release
  source = "git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-vpc.git//modules/vpc-mgmt?ref=<VERSION>"

  aws_region       = var.aws_region
  vpc_name         = var.vpc_name
  cidr_block       = var.cidr_block
  num_nat_gateways = var.num_nat_gateways
}
----

This code does the following:

Terraform module support::
  This code pulls in a module using Terraform's native `module` functionality. For background info, see
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-create-reusable-infrastructure-with-terraform-modules-25526d65f73d[How to create reusable infrastructure with Terraform modules].

SSH Git URL::
  The `source` URL in the code above uses a Git URL with SSH authentication (see
  https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html[module sources] for all the types of `source` URLs you can use).
  If you followed the SSH instructions in <<get_access>>, this will allow you to access private repos in the Gruntwork
  Service Catalog without having to hard-code a password in your Terraform code.

Versioned URL::
  Note the `?ref=<VERSION>` at the end of the `source` URL. This parameter allows you to pull in a specific version of
  each module so that you don't accidentally pull in (potentially backwards incompatible code) in the future. You
  should replace `<VERSION>` with the latest version from the releases page of the repo you're using (e.g., here's
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc/releases[the releases page for module-vpc]).

Module arguments::
  Below the `source` URL, you'll need to pass in the module-specific arguments. You can find all the required and
  optional variables defined in `vars.tf` (old name` or `variables.tf` (new name) of the module (e.g.,
  here's https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc/blob/master/modules/vpc-app/vars.tf[the variables.tf for vpc-app]).
  The code above sets these to input variables (which you'll define shortly) so that you can use different values in
  different environments.

Let's add the new input variables in `variables.tf`:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/variables.tf
[source,hcl]
----
variable "vpc_name" {
  description = "Name of the VPC. Examples include 'prod', 'dev', 'mgmt', etc."
  type        = string
}

variable "cidr_block" {
  description = "The IP address range of the VPC in CIDR notation. A prefix of /16 is recommended. Do not use a prefix higher than /27. Example: '10.100.0.0/16'."
  type        = string
}

variable "num_nat_gateways" {
  description = "The number of NAT Gateways to launch for this VPC. For production VPCs, multiple NAT Gateways are recommended."
  type        = number
}
----

You may also want to add useful output variables in `outputs.tf`:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/variables.tf
[source,hcl]
----
output "vpc_name" {
  description = "The VPC name"
  value       = module.vpc.vpc_name
}

output "vpc_id" {
  description = "The VPC ID"
  value       = module.vpc.vpc_id
}

output "vpc_cidr_block" {
  description = "The VPC CIDR block"
  value       = module.vpc.vpc_cidr_block
}

output "public_subnet_cidr_blocks" {
  description = "The CIDR blocks of the public subnets"
  value       = module.vpc.public_subnet_cidr_blocks
}

output "private_app_subnet_cidr_blocks" {
  description = "The CIDR blocks of the private app subnets"
  value       = module.vpc.private_app_subnet_cidr_blocks
}

output "private_persistence_subnet_cidr_blocks" {
  description = "The CIDR blocks of the private persistence subnets"
  value       = module.vpc.private_persistence_subnet_cidr_blocks
}

output "public_subnet_ids" {
  description = "The IDs of the public subnets"
  value       = module.vpc.public_subnet_ids
}

output "private_app_subnet_ids" {
  description = "The IDs of the private app subnets"
  value       = module.vpc.private_app_subnet_ids
}

output "private_persistence_subnet_ids" {
  description = "The IDs of the private persistence subnets"
  value       = module.vpc.private_persistence_subnet_ids
}
----

==== Manual tests

Now that the code is written, you may want to test it manually. We recommend testing in a _sandbox environment_ where
you can deploy infrastructure without affecting any other environments (especially production!). For example, if you're
using AWS, this should be a separate AWS account.

The easiest way to test is to create a `testing.tfvars` file:

----
infrastructure-modules
  â”” networking
    â”” vpc-app
      â”” main.tf
      â”” outputs.tf
      â”” variables.tf
      â”” testing.tfvars
----

Inside this file, you can set all the variables for your module to test-friendly values:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/testing.tfvars
[source,hcl]
----
aws_region       = "us-east-2"
aws_account_id   = "555566667777"
vpc_name         = "example-vpc"
cidr_block       = "10.0.0.0/16"
num_nat_gateways = 1
----

You may also want to add a `testing-backend.hcl` file:

----
infrastructure-modules
  â”” networking
    â”” vpc-app
      â”” main.tf
      â”” outputs.tf
      â”” variables.tf
      â”” testing.tfvars
      â”” testing-backend.hcl
----

In this file, you can configure test-friendly settings for your backend. For example, if you're using the S3 backend,
you can specifiy:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc-app/testing-backend.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
bucket = "<YOUR-BUCKET-FOR-TESTING>"
key    = "manual-testing/<YOUR-NAME>/terraform.tfstate"
region = "us-east-2"
----

You can now test manually as follows:

. Authenticate to your sandbox environment (see
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-authenticating-to-aws-on-the-command-line-63656a686799[A Comprehensive Guide to Authenticating to AWS on the Command Line])
. Run `terraform init -backend-config=testing-backend.hcl`
. Run `terraform apply -var-file=testing.tfvars`
. Manually validate the code is working as you expect
. When you're done, run `terraform destroy -var-file=testing.tfvars` to clean up after yourself

==== Automated tests

You may also want to create automated tests for your module. Automated tests for infrastructure code will spin up and
tear down a lot of infrastructure, so we recommend a separate _testing environment_ (e.g. yet another AWS account) for
running automated testsâ€”separate even from the sandboxes you use for manual testing.

The only way to build confidence that your infrastructure code works as you expect is to deploy it into a real AWS
account. That means you'll primarily be writing integration tests that:

. Run `terraform apply` to deploy your module
. Perform a bunch of validations that the deployed infrastructure works as expected
. Run `terraform destroy` at the end to clean up

In short, you're automating the steps you took to manually test your module!

You can make it easier to write tests of this format by leveraging https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/[Terratest],
an open source Go library that contains helpers for testing many types of infrastructure code, including Terraform,
Packer, and Docker.

You can define tests for your `vpc-app` module in a `vpc_app_test.go` file in a `test` folder:

----
infrastructure-modules
  â”” networking
    â”” vpc-app
      â”” main.tf
      â”” outputs.tf
      â”” variables.tf
      â”” testing.tfvars
      â”” testing-backend.hcl
  â”” test
    â”” vpc_app_test.go
----

Check out the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/#quickstart[Terratest install instructions] for how to
configure your environment for Go and install Terratestt.

Next, write some test code in `vpc_app_test.go` that looks like this:

.infrastructure-modules/test/vpc_app_test.go
[source,go]
----
package test

import (
	"testing"

	"fmt"
	"github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/random"
	"github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform"
)

// The ID of the your AWS account for testing
const awsAccountId = "111122223333"

// An AWS region to test in
const awsRegionForTest = "us-east-2"

// S3 bucket to use for testing
const s3BucketForTesting = "<YOUR-S3-BUCKET>"

func TestVpcApp(t *testing.T) {
	t.Parallel()

	// Unique ID to namespace resources
	uniqueId := random.UniqueId()
	// Generate a unique name for each VPC so tests running in parallel don't clash
    vpcName := fmt.Sprintf("test-vpc-%s", uniqueId)
    // Generate a unique key in the S3 bucket for the Terraform state
    backendS3Key := fmt.Sprintf("vpc-app-test/%s/terraform.tfstate", uniqueId)

	terraformOptions := &terraform.Options {
		// Where the Terraform code is located
		TerraformDir: "../networking/vpc-app",

		// Variables to pass to the Terraform code
		Vars: map[string]interface{}{
		    "aws_region":       awsRegionForTest,
            "aws_account_id":   awsAccountId,
            "vpc_name":         vpcName,
            "cidr_block":       "10.0.0.0/16",
            "num_nat_gateways": 1,

		},

		// Backend configuration to pass to the Terraform code
		BackendConfig: map[string]interface{}{
            "bucket":   s3BucketForTesting,
            "key":      backendS3Key,
            "region":   awsRegionForTest,

		},
	}

	// Run 'terraform destroy' at the end of the test to clean up
	defer terraform.Destroy(t, terraformOptions)

	// Run 'terraform init' and 'terraform apply' to deploy the module
	terraform.InitAndApply(t, terraformOptions)
}
----

The test code above implements a minimal test that:

Configure variables::
  This is similar to the `testing.tfvars` used in manual testing.

Configure the backend::
  This is similar to tthe `testing-backend.hcl` used in manual testing.

Namespace resources::
  The code used `random.UniqueId()` to generate unique identifiers for all the resources in this test. This allows
  multiple tests to run in parallel (e.g., on your computer, your teammates' computers, CI servers) without the
  any clashes (e.g., without conflicts over unique VPC names).

Defer terraform destroy::
  The test code uses `defer` to schedule `terraform.Destroy` to run at the end of the test, whether or not the test
  passes.

terraform init and apply::
  The test runs `terraform init` and `terraform apply` on the module. If this hits any errors, the test will fail.

This is a minimal test that just makes sure your module can deploy and undeploy successfully. This is a great start,
and will catch a surprising number of bugs, but for production-grade code, you'll probably want more validation logic.
Check out the real https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc/tree/master/test[module-vpc tests] to see how we validate
VPCs by, for example, launching EC2 instances in various subnets and making sure that connections to some of them work,
and others are blocked, based on the networking settings in that VPC.

To run the test, authenticate to your testing environment (see
https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-authenticating-to-aws-on-the-command-line-63656a686799[A Comprehensive Guide to Authenticating to AWS on the Command Line])
and do the following:

----
$ cd test
$ go test -v -timeout 45m
----

Note the use of the `-timeout 45m` argument with +go test+. By default, Go imposes a time limit of 10 minutes for
tests, after which it forcibly kills the test run, causing the tests to not only fail, but even preventing the cleanup
code (i.e., `terraform destroy`) from running. This VPC test should take closer to ten minutes, but whenever running a
Go test that deploys real infrastructure, it's safer to set an extra long timeout to avoid the test being killed part
way through and leaving all sorts of infrastructure still running.

For a lot more information on writing automated tests for Terraform code, see:

. https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/[Terratest documentation], especially the many examples and corresponding
  tests in the `examples` and `test` folders, respectively, and the
  https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/#testing-best-practices[testing best practices] section.
. _https://www.terraformupandrunning.com[Terraform: Up & Running]_, 2nd edition, has an entire chapter dedicated to
  automated testing for Terraform code, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, dependency injection,
  running tests in parallel, test stages, and more.

==== Deploying

Now that your module has been thoroughly tested, you can deploy it to your real environments (e.g., staging and
production).
