== Intro

This guide will walk you through how to use code from the
https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Service Catalog], including how to use Terraform
modules, Terragrunt, scripts, binaries, versioning, forking, and more.

=== What is the Gruntwork Service Catalog?

The https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Service Catalog] is a collection of over 300,000
lines of reusable, battle-tested, production-ready infrastructure code for AWS, GCP, and Azure. The Gruntwork Service
Catalog gives your team the following benefits:

Go to prod in days, not months::
  Most teams have the same basic infrastructure needs (e.g., Docker cluster, load balancer, database, cache, CI/CD,
  monitoring, secrets management, and so on), so instead of wasting months reinventing the wheel and building these
  same pieces from scratch, you get to leverage a library of reusable, battle-tested, off-the-shelf infrastructure
  that has been built by a team of DevOps experts and proven in production at hundreds of companies.

Customize everything using infrastructure as code::
  Everything in the Gruntwork Service Catalog is defined as code (primarily in Terraform, Go, Python, and Bash) and you
  get full access to 100% of this code. You can combine and compose this code in any way you wish, see how everything
  works under the hood, debug any issues you run into, and customize and modify the code to fit your exact needs.

Learn best practices::
  The Service Catalog is thoroughly documented and comes with the https://gruntwork.io/training/[DevOps Training Library],
  a collection of video training courses that teach a variety of DevOps topics, such as infrastructure as code,
  Terraform, Docker, Packer, AWS, GCP, security, and more.

Keep everything up to date::
  All of the code in the Service Catalog is semantically versioned and we are constantly releasing new versions with
  the latest best practices, new features, and bug fixes. Never miss a critical security fix again. Never waste months
  updating to the latest version of Terraform. Just follow the instructions in our
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter[monthly newsletter] to get better infrastructure through a
  version number bump.

Get commercial support::
  Get access to a team of DevOps experts who can help you set up your infrastructure, build highly available and
  scalable systems, automate your builds and deployments, troubleshoot issues, and avoid gotchas and pitfalls. Reach out
  to us via Slack, email, and phone/video calls, get code reviews, prioritized bug fixes, and SLAs on response times.

=== What you'll learn in this guide

This guide consists of four main sections:

<<core_concepts>>::
  An overview of the core concepts you need to understand to use the Gruntwork Service Catalog, including how the
  Service Catalog is designed, infrastructure as code, Terraform, Terragrunt, Packer, Docker, immutable infrastructure,
  versioning, automated testing, and more.

// TODO: link to checklist below
<<production_grade_design>>::
  An overview of how to use the Gruntwork Service Catalog to build production-grade infrastructure. To get a
  sense of what production-grade means, check out the production-grade infrastructure checklist.

<<deployment_walkthrough>>::
  A step-by-step guide to deploying several services from the Gruntwork Service Catalog to give you some hands-on
  practice.

<<next_steps>>::
  What to do next once you've finished reading this guide.
