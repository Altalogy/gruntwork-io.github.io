== Intro

This guide will walk you through how to use code from the
https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Service Catalog], including how to use Terraform
modules, Terragrunt, scripts, binaries, versioning, forking, and more.

=== What is the Gruntwork Service Catalog?

=== What you'll learn in this guide

This guide consists of four main sections:

<<core_concepts>>::
  An overview of the core concepts you need to understand to use the Gruntwork Service Catalog, including how the
  Service Catalog is designed, infrastructure as code, Terraform, Terragrunt, Packer, Docker, immutable infrastructure,
  versioning, automated testing, and more.

// TODO: link to checklist below
<<production_grade_design>>::
  An overview of how to use the Gruntwork Service Catalog to build production-grade infrastructure. To get a
  sense of what production-grade means, check out the production-grade infrastructure checklist.

<<deployment_walkthrough>>::
  A step-by-step guide to deploying several services from the Gruntwork Service Catalog to give you some hands-on
  practice.

<<next_steps>>::
  What to do next once you've finished reading this guide.

Feel free to read the guide start to finish or skip around to whatever part interests you!
