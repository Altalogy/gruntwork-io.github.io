== Intro
This is a complete guide to help you achieve compliance with the
link:https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/amazon_web_services/[CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark] using
link:https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library] in
conjunction with a series of compliance-specific wrapper modules. By following this guide and utilizing the
associated modules, you can launch infrastructure that is compliant with the Benchmark recommendations, and you'll be
set to retain a compliant state over time because all of the infrastructure is defined as code.

=== What is the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark?
The link:https://www.cisecurity.org/resources/?type=benchmark[CIS Benchmarks] are objective, consensus-driven
configuration guidelines developed by security experts to help organizations improve their security posture.
The AWS Foundations Benchmark is a set of configuration best practices for hardening AWS accounts to establish
a secure foundation for running workloads on AWS. It also provides ongoing monitoring to ensure that the
account remains secure.

=== What you'll learn in this guide

This guide consists of five main sections:

<<core_concepts>>::
  An overview of the AWS Foundations Benchmark, including its control sections and structure.

<<production_grade_design>>::
  How to use infrastructure as code to achieve compliance with minimal redundancy and maximum flexibility.

<<deployment_walkthrough>>::
  A step-by-step guide to achieving compliance using the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library and the
  Gruntwork CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark wrapper modules.

<<next_steps>>::
  How to measure and maintain compliance

<<traceability_matrix>>::
  A reference table that maps each Benchmark recommendation to the corresponding section in the deployment
walkthrough.


Feel free to read the guide from start to finish or skip around to whatever part interests you!

[[core_concepts]]
== Core concepts

The CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark is organized by four sections:
 +
 +

. Identity and Access Management
. Logging
. Monitoring
. Networking

There are multiple recommendations within each section. Note the use of the term _recommendation_ as opposed
to _control_ or _requirement_. This reinforces the point that CIS is a self-imposed, best-practices standard,
as opposed to compulsory or regulated and centralized standards such as the
link:https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/[PCI DSS] for the payment card industry or
link:https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html[HIPAA] for covered
health care entities.

=== Scoring
Each recommendation is classified as either _Scored_ or _Not Scored_. _Scored_ recommendations indicate that
the check for the recommendation may be accessed programmatically (e.g., an API exists to validate or enable
the recommendation). _Not Scored_ recommendations must be checked and remediated manually. To reach
compliance, each scored item must pass an audit.

=== Profiles
The Benchmark defines two profile levels. Level one recommendations are easier to implement, incur less
overhead, but still substantially improve security. Level two recommendations are meant for highly sensitive
environments with a lower risk appetite. They may be more difficult to implement and/or cause more overhead in
day-to-day usage.

=== CIS Controls

Each recommendation is also linked to a corresponding link:https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/[CIS Control]. The
controls are distinct from the Benchmark. They're described by CIS as "a prioritized set of actions that collectively
form a defense-in-depth set of best practices that mitigate the most common attacks against systems and networks."
Organizations seeking to implement a comprehensive security program or framework can use the controls to measure their
progress and prioritize security efforts. The Foundations Benchmark is just one of several guidelines that can help
reach the bar set by the CIS Controls. Refer to the Benchmark document directly to view how the recommendations map to
controls.

=== Recommendation sections

==== Identity and Access Management
_Number of recommendations: 22_

The recommendations in this section involve the use of identity, accounts, authentication, and authorization.
On AWS, most identity and access control related concerns are managed using the
link:https://aws.amazon.com/iam/[eponymous IAM service]. Hence, most (but not all) of the recommendations in
this section discuss particular IAM configurations, such as the configuration of the password policy, the use
of various groups and roles, and the configuration of multi-factor authentication (MFA) devices.

==== Logging
_Number of recommendations: 9_

AWS has a variety of logging, monitoring, and auditing features, and the Benchmark has recommendations for
several of them:

* link:https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/[AWS CloudTrail] tracks user activity and API usage
* link:https://aws.amazon.com/config/[AWS Config] records and evaluates resource configurations
* link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html[VPC Flow Logs] capture network traffic information
  in VPCs

AWS has several other logging related features that are not covered directly by the Benchmark. For example,
the primary log ingestion and query service, link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html[Amazon CloudWatch
Logs], is integrated with many other AWS services. The Benchmark does not contain any recommendations
specifically for CloudWatch Logs, though many recommendations do make mention of it.

==== Monitoring
_Number of recommendations: 14_

Monitoring is an overloaded term in the industry. In the context of the AWS Foundations Benchmark, the
monitoring section is exclusively about monitoring for specific API calls using the CloudTrail service paired
with link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/MonitoringLogData.html[CloudWatch Logs
filter metrics]. Each recommendation in this section spells out a specific filter and an associated alarm.

==== Networking
_Number of recommendations: 4_

The Benchmark is uncomfortably light on networking, considering its central role in the security of any
distributed system. The recommendations merely limit traffic from the zero network (`0.0.0.0/0`) and
restrict routing for VPC peering connections.

[[production_grade_design]]
== Production-grade design

Gruntwork offers battle-tested infrastructure as code modules to help you create production grade
infrastructure in a fraction of the time it would take to develop from scratch. Each of the IaC modules are
"compliance-ready"; they are mostly unopionated by default, but they can be configured for compliance with the
right settings.
 +
To make it easy to achieve compliance, the Gruntwork Compliance modules are "wrappers" around the core,
unopionated modules in the Infrastructure as Code Library. The wrappers call the core modules with
configuration values that are compliant with the AWS Foundations Benchmark. You can use the wrapper modules by
creating a module of your own (this can be considered a second wrapper) and using the compliance module as the
`source`. Optionally, you can also use `terragrunt` to call your module, thus creating a chain of IaC
modules.
 +
 +

.Nested wrapper modules help to avoid repetitive code and minimize the amount of extra work needed to achieve compliance.
image::/assets/img/guides/cis-compliance/wrappers.png[]

Let's unpack this a bit.

[[core_modules]]
=== Core modules
Core modules are broadly applicable and can be used with or without compliance requirements. For example,
the link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/blob/master/modules/iam-groups/README.md[`iam-groups`
core module] creates a best practices set of IAM groups. The groups are configurable according to your needs.
You could, for example, choose to create a group with read-only access, another group with full administrator
access, and no other groups. All Gruntwork subscribers have access to the core modules, which reside in
Gruntwork's link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/toc[infrastructure as code repositories].

[[wrapper_modules]]
=== Compliance wrapper modules
The compliance wrapper modules are an extension of the IaC Library. They use the
link:https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html[`source` argument in a Terraform module block] to invoke
the core module with a configuration that is customized for compliance with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark.
These modules are in the link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws[`cis-compliance-aws`
repository] (accessible to Gruntwork Compliance subscribers).

[[infrastructure_modules]]
=== infrastructure-modules
The `infrastructure-modules` are your organization's "blueprint" for how to deploy infrastructure. You can
use `infrastructure-modules` to customize the settings according to the needs of your environment. Subscribers
can refer to the
canonical link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-modules-multi-account-acme[ACME infrastructure-modules
reposistory] for an example of how you might use `infrastructure-modules`.

If you're using Terragrunt, the `infrastructure-modules` are optional; you can call the compliance
wrapper modules directly as the `source` from a Terragrunt configuration. The benefit of this is that you have less code to maintain by depending directly on Gruntwork's upstream compliance modules.

[[infrastructure_live]]
=== infrastructure-live
`infrastructure-live` uses link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt[Terragrunt] to make it easier to
work with Terraform modules in multiple environments. `infrastructure-live` is optional - you can use all of the modules
with or without Terragrunt.

If you're not using Terragrunt, you can use `infrastructure-modules` to call the compliance
wrapper modules. Refer to the canonical link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-live-multi-account-acme[ACME
infrastructure-live repository], and in particular the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-live-multi-account-acme/tree/master/_docs[Infrastructure
walkthrough] for comprehensive documentation on how `infrastructure-live`, `infrastructure-modules`, and the core IaC
modules interact.
 +
[[benefits]]
=== Benefits
This modular, decomposed approach allows for maximum code reuse. The core modules can be used with or without
compliance, depending on how they are configured. The compliance wrappers are like shadows of the core
modules; they pass through most of the variables to the core modules without alteration, but hard code any
settings needed for compliance. When you call the compliance modules from your own code in
`infrastructure-modules`, you only need to set up any variables that are custom for your environment. Often
times the default settings are good enough.
 +

If you need to brush up on how the IaC Library works, read the
link:https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library/[How to use
the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library] guide.

[[deployment_walkthrough]]
== Deployment walkthrough
This section is a step-by-step walkthrough for achieving compliance with the AWS Foundations Benchmark
out-of-the-box using the Infrastructure as Code modules from Gruntwork.

[[pre_requisites]]
=== Pre-requisites

This walkthrough has the following pre-requistes:

Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library::
  This guide uses code from the https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library], as it
  implements most of the production-grade design for you out of the box. Make sure to read
  link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library[How to use the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code Library].

Gruntwork Compliance for CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark::
  This guide also uses code from the https://gruntwork.io/compliance/cis-aws-foundations-benchmark/[Gruntwork CIS AWS
  Foundations Benchmark repository], which contains the necessary configurations to achieve compliance.
+
IMPORTANT: You must be a [js-subscribe-cta]#Gruntwork Compliance subscriber# to access the Gruntwork
Infrastructure as Code Library and the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark modules.

Terraform::
  This guide uses https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform] to define and manage all the infrastructure as code. If
  you're not familiar with Terraform, check out
  https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-terraform-b3d32832baca[A Comprehensive Guide to Terraform],
  https://training.gruntwork.io/p/terraform[A Crash Course on Terraform], and
  link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library[How to Use the Gruntwork
  Infrastructure as Code Library].

[[manual_steps]]
=== Manual steps
A few of the Benchmark recommendations are not achievable via API and require a one-time manual configuration.
Perform the steps in this section manually.

[[root_mfa]]
==== Enable MFA for the root account
Securing the "root" user, or the first user that is created when you set up an AWS account, is one of the
first actions you should take in any new account. Unfortunately, there is no API or automation available for
configuring an MFA device for the root user. Follow the manual steps outlined in the
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html#id_root-user_manage_mfa[AWS docs].

For the paranoid: configure a hardware MFA device. We suggest using a link:https://www.yubico.com/[Yubikey]
due to its reputation for strong security characteristics and multitude of form factors. Refer to
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_physical.html#enable-hw-mfa-for-root[
the documentation for more information on using a hardware device with the root user].

[[security_questions]]
==== Answer security questions and complete contact details
When setting up a new account, AWS asks for contact information and security questions. Unfortunately, there
is no API or automation available for this functionality. Follow the manual steps outlined in the CIS
Benchmark document and refer to the link:https://aws.amazon.com/answers/security/aws-secure-account-setup/[AWS Secure Account Setup steps].

[[create_password_policy]]
=== Create an IAM user password policy
After the manual steps are complete, the next step is to create an IAM user password policy using the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/blob/master/examples/iam-password-policy/README.adoc[`iam-password-policy`
wrapper module]. Complete this step before creating any IAM users!

[[wrapper_code]]
==== Using the wrapper module
This section demonstrates how to use the password policy wrapper module to create a password policy. Follow this pattern for each of the wrapper modules discussed throughout this walkthrough.

===== Using the wrapper module with Terraform
If you're using Terraform, first create a module in your `infrastructure-modules` repository.

----
infrastructure-modules
└── security
    └── iam-password-policy
        ├── main.tf
        └── variables.tf
----

Inside of `main.tf`, configure your AWS provider settings:

.infrastructure-modules/security/iam-password-policy/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}
----

Now use the `iam-password-policy` compliance module from the Gruntwork `cis-compliance-aws` repository, making sure to
replace the `<VERSION>` placeholder with the latest version from the
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/releases[releases page]:

.infrastructure-modules/security/iam-password-policy/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "iam_password_policy" {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest cis-compliance-aws release
  source                  = "git@github.com:gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws.git//modules/iam-password-policy?ref=<VERSION>"
  minimum_password_length = var.minimum_password_length
  aws_region              = var.aws_region
}
----

The module parameters should be exposed as input variables in `variables.tf`:

.infrastructure-modules/security/iam-password-policy/variables.tf
[source,hcl]
----
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "The AWS region in which all resources will be created"
  type        = string
}

variable "minimum_password_length" {
  description = "Minimum length to require for user passwords."
  type        = number
  default     = 20
}
----

With the module in place, it's time to test your code. See
link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library#manual_tests_terraform[Manual tests for
Terraform code] and
link:/guides/foundations/how-to-use-gruntwork-infrastructure-as-code-library#automated_tests_terraform[Automated tests
for Terraform code] for instructions.

[[merge_release_password_policy_module]]
===== Merge and release your password policy module

Once the module is working the way you want, submit a pull request, get your changes merged into the `master` branch,
and create a new versioned release by using a Git tag. For example, to create a `v0.3.0` release:

[source,bash]
----
git tag -a "v0.3.0" -m "Created iam-password-policy module"
git push --follow-tags
----

With the module released, you can use Terraform to create the password policy. Follow the instructions in the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/tree/master/examples/iam-password-policy/terraform[terraform usage example].

===== Using the compliance wrapper module with Terragrunt

If you're using Terragrunt, configure a `terragrunt.hcl` to invoke the wrapper module. First, create a directory for the password policy in your `infrastructure-live` repository:

----
infrastructure-live
└── <your account>
    └── _global
        └── iam-password-policy
            └── terragrunt.hcl
----

In this directory structure above, `<your account>` is a friendly name for the account you're configuring for compliance. For example, the `prod` account or the `security` account. If this doesn't make sense, see link:https://blog.gruntwork.io/terragrunt-how-to-keep-your-terraform-code-dry-and-maintainable-f61ae06959d8[this post] for more information on Terragrunt.

Next, create `terragrunt.hcl` with the following contents:

.infrastructure-live/<your account>/_global/iam-password-policy/terragrunt.hcl
[source,hcl]
----
terraform {
  # Make sure to replace <VERSION> in this URL with the latest cis-compliance-aws release
  source = "git::ssh://git@github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws.git//modules/iam-password-policy?ref=<VERSION>"
}

# Include all settings from the root terragrunt.hcl file
include {
  path = find_in_parent_folders()
}
----

You can test this by simply running `terragrunt apply`. This will pull the `iam-password-policy` compliance module and apply it using the credentials you have defined in `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. When you're satisfied with the configuration, follow the merge process described in <<merge_release_terragrunt_wrapper>>.

See also the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/tree/master/examples/iam-password-policy/terragrunt[terragrunt
usage example].

[[configure_authentication]]
=== Configure authentication
There is more than one way to authenticate to AWS, and the method you choose determines which modules you should use to achieve compliance.

The recommended method is to use link:https://aws.amazon.com/identity/saml/[federated SAML authentication] with
an identity provider (IdP) like Okta or Active Directory. In this configuration, users authenticate to the
IdP, and IAM roles are used to grant permissions in AWS. If you're using SAML, continue with section
<<saml_authentication>>

Another option is to use IAM users. IAM users log directly in to AWS, and it's crucial to configure the IAM
user settings securely. IAM users are easier to get started with than SAML, and they're also free to use. IAM
users may be more suitable for smaller environments with only a few users. If you are using IAM users,
continue with <<iam_user_authentication>>.

If you're new to AWS accounts, refer to the Gruntwork guide
link:https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-configure-production-grade-aws-account-structure/[How to
configure a production-grade AWS account structure] to learn more about AWS account design.


[[saml_authentication]]
==== Steps for authentication via SAML
If you're unfamiliar with SAML authentication and identity providers, start with the
link:https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-configure-production-grade-aws-account-structure/#federated-authentication[federated
authentication section] of the Gruntwork production-grade AWS account structure guide. You may also find the
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html#CreatingSAML-configuring-role[AWS
SAML-based Federation documentation] to be helpful. Once you select an IdP, populate it with users and follow
the provider's documentation to configure SAML with AWS. If you use SAML authentication alone, with no IAM users, the
account will immediately be compliant with several of the Benchmark recommendations!

Once the IdP is ready, proceed with the steps below.

Set up IAM roles for SAML::
Use the link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/blob/master/modules/saml-iam-roles/README.adoc[`saml-iam-roles`
wrapper module] to configure a compliant-set of IAM roles and policies by following the pattern outlined in <<wrapper_code>>. The module creates a minimal, best
practices set of of IAM roles that may be assumed from the SAML provider. Tweak the `vars.tf` according to
your needs.

Enable MFA in the IdP::
Ensure that MFA is configured for all AWS users in your IdP. Strictly speaking, MFA in the IdP is not
required for compliance with the Benchmark. However, the intent of the Benchmark requirement is that all AWS
users should have MFA, and we strongly advise this practice.

Create an IAM group for access to support::
Use the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/blob/master/modules/iam-groups/README.adoc[`iam-groups`
wrapper module] to create a standardized set of IAM groups by following the pattern outlined in <<wrapper_code>>. The module will create a group called `support`
with the `AWSSupportAccess` managed policy attached. Customize the variables in the module to create only the
groups you want.

Use the IAM admin role for administration::
To ensure compliance with recommendation 1.22, the `saml-iam-roles` wrapper module does not create any roles
with explicit administrator (`+*:*+`) permissions. Instead, to grant "effective" administrator access to a
SAML user, use the `allow-iam-admin-access-from-saml` role. Users that assume this role have the ability to
grant, revoke, and update IAM permissions as needed. From a privileges standpoint, this is the same as full
administrator access, so be judicious with this permission.

Avoid logging in as the root user::
With SAML authentication enabled and administrative access via the IAM admin role, you shouldn't need to log
in with the root account very often. Unfortunately, there is nothing built-in to AWS to prevent use of the
root user. It cannot be locked or removed from the account. In fact, there are
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html[several tasks that require
the use of root].  Fortunately, most of these activities are rare, so usage of the root account can be kept to
a minimum.

If you need to provision IAM users in addition to SAML, proceed with <<iam_user_authentication>>. Otherwise,
continue with <<iam_roles_for_instances>>.

[[iam_user_authentication]]
==== Steps for authentication via IAM users
If you're new to IAM, refer to the
link:https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-configure-production-grade-aws-account-structure/#aws-account[Core
concepts section] of the production-grade AWS account structure guide. Once you're familiar with IAM, proceed
with the following configuration steps:

Create cross-account roles::
If you're using multiple AWS accounts, the best way to set up access to each account is to create a set of
roles that can be assumed from a central account using the
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html[AssumeRole] feature. This way you
only need to create IAM users in the central account rather than in each account individually . You can create
roles in your sub accounts using the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/blob/master/modules/cross-account-iam-roles/README.adoc[`cross-account-iam-roles`
wrapper module] and the pattern outlined in <<wrapper_code>>.

Refer to the
link:https://gruntwork.io/guides/foundations/how-to-configure-production-grade-aws-account-structure/#iam-roles[IAM
roles] section of the production-grade AWS account structure guide to learn more about cross-account roles.

Create IAM groups::
Next, create a compliant set of IAM groups with the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/blob/master/modules/iam-groups/README.adoc[`iam-groups`
wrapper module] by following the pattern outlined in <<wrapper_code>>. If you're using multiple AWS accounts, add the roles created in the previous step to the
`iam_groups_for_cross_account_access` list.

Create IAM users::
Now use the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/blob/master/modules/iam-users/README.md[`iam-users`
core module] to create users and add them to the groups created in the previous step. Follow the pattern outlined in
<<wrapper_code>> to use the `iam-users` module, even though there isn't a wrapper module for `iam-users` because there isn't anything particular needed to reach
compliance.

If you are using multiple AWS accounts, create users in a central AWS account that you wish to use for
authentication. For example, you might use a "security" account for authentication, and use the previously
created cross-account roles and associated IAM groups to enable users to use AssumeRole to access other
accounts (e.g. dev, stage, and prdouction) where your applications run.

(Optional) Create custom IAM groups or roles::
If you need to create customized IAM groups and/or roles, use the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/blob/master/modules/custom-iam-entity/README.adoc[`custom-iam-entity`
wrapper module]. You can use this module to attach managed policies to roles and groups, and to require that MFA is in use. Refer to the link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/blob/master/examples/custom-iam-entity/README.md[example usage].

[[iam_roles_for_instances]]
=== Use IAM roles for EC2 instances
All Gruntwork modules that require AWS API access use roles rather than an IAM user with static API credentials for
authentication. For example:

* link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-server/blob/master/modules/single-server/main.tf[`module-server`]
 is used to manage a single EC2 instance with an IAM role attached.
* link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-asg[`module-asg`] applies IAM roles to instances in auto-scaling
 group.
* link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-eks/blob/master/modules/eks-cluster-workers/main.tf[`terraform-aws-eks`]
 uses IAM roles for EKS cluster workers.
* link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-ecs/tree/master/modules/ecs-cluster[`ecs-cluster`] creates IAM
 roles for ECS instances
* link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-lambda/tree/master/modules/lambda[`lambda`] creates IAM
 roles for Lambda functions

Use these modules whenever possible. You should always use IAM roles in your own modules any time you need to provide access to the AWS API. Using static API credentials should be avoided whenever possible.

[[maintain_compliance]]
=== Maintaining compliance by following IAM best practices
We conclude the IAM section with a few parting words of wisdom for maintaining compliance over time:

. Do not attach any policies without requiring MFA.
. Never use the `AdministratorAccess` AWS managed policy with any users, groups, or roles.
. Refrain from granting inline permissions or attaching managed policies directly to IAM users. Permissions
should be granted exclusively via IAM groups and roles.
. Never use static IAM user access keys to allow an application to access AWS, whether that application is hosted on an EC2 instance or anywhere else!

Next, continue with the <<configure_logging>> section.

[[configure_logging]]
=== Configure logging
The logging section of the Benchmark includes configurations for CloudTrail, AWS Config, KMS keys, and VPC
flow logs.

[[cloudtrail]]
==== CloudTrail
Use the link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/blob/master/modules/cloudtrail/README.adoc[`cloudtrail`
wrapper module] to establish a compliant CloudTrail configuration. The wrapper module will configure CloudTrail with the
following characteristics:

. Collects events
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/receive-cloudtrail-log-files-from-multiple-regions.html[in
all regions]
. Enables
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-log-file-validation-intro.html[log
file integrity validation]
. Ensures that the S3 bucket used by CloudTrail is not publicly accessible
. Integrates
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/send-cloudtrail-events-to-cloudwatch-logs.html[CloudTrail
with CloudWatch Logs]
. link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/encrypting-cloudtrail-log-files-with-aws-kms.html[Encrypts
CloudTrail logs at rest]
. Enables link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html[access logging] for the CloudTrail S3 bucket

Refer to the link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/blob/master/examples/cloudtrail/terraform/README.md[terraform] and link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/blob/master/examples/cloudtrail/terragrunt/README.md[terragrunt] examples.

[[aws_config]]
==== Enable AWS Config in all regions
Gruntwork has created a code generation utility to make it simple to enable AWS Config in every region of an
AWS account. Refer to the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/blob/master/modules/generate-aws-config/README.adoc[`generate-aws-config`
documentation] for the details. Use the utility to enable AWS Config in all regions along with a global
configuration recorder in one region, as per the Benchmark recommendation.

[[kms]]
==== Enable key rotation for KMS keys
Use the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/blob/master/modules/kms-master-key/README.md[`kms-master-key`
module] to create KMS keys with key rotation enabled by default.

[[vpc_flow_logs]]
==== Create VPC flow logs
The Benchmark recommends enabling link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html[VPC Flow Logs]
for all VPCs in all regions. You can use the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc/blob/master/modules/vpc-flow-logs/README.md[`vpc-flow-logs` core module]
to create a flow log for a given VPC. For example, you might first create a VPC using `module-vpc`:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc/myvpc/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
data "aws_availability_zones" "all" {}

module "vpc" {
  # Replace <VERSION> with the most recent release from the https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc/releases[releases page]:
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-vpc.git//modules/vpc-flow-logs?ref=<VERSION>"

  vpc_name   = var.vpc_name
  aws_region = var.aws_region

  cidr_block             = var.cidr_block
  num_nat_gateways       = var.num_nat_gateways
  num_availability_zones = length(data.aws_availability_zones.all.names)
}
----

Then create a Flow Log for the VPC:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc/myvpc/main.tf
[source,hcl]
----
module "flow_logs" {
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-vpc.git//modules/vpc-flow-logs?ref=<VERSION>"

  # We refer to the VPC ID created by the module above
  vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id
  kms_key_users = var.kms_key_users
}
----

All that's remaining is to define the parameters in a `variables.tf`:

.infrastructure-modules/networking/vpc/myvpc/variables.tf
[source,hcl]
----
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "The AWS region to deploy to (e.g. us-east-1)"
  type        = string
}

variable "vpc_name" {
  description = "The name of the VPC to create"
  type        = string
}

variable "kms_key_users" {
  description = "A list of IAM user ARNs with access to the KMS key used with the VPC flow logs. Required if kms_key_arn is not defined."
  type        = list(string)
}
----

Refer to the flow logs
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc/blob/master/examples/vpc-flow-logs/main.tf[example code].

To limit the number of flow logs, you may want to use the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke[`cloud-nuke defaults-aws`] command. It will remove the default VPC from
all regions in an account, saving you the hassle of creating flow logs in each default VPC.

[[configure_monitoring]]
=== Configure monitoring
The Monitoring section of the Benchmark centers on a collection of
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/MonitoringLogData.html[CloudWatch Logs Metric
Filters]. Gruntwork has simplified this section to a single module: the
link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/blob/master/modules/cloudwatch-logs-metric-filters/README.adoc[`cloudwatch-logs-metric
-filters` wrapper module]. It will create and configure all the CloudWatch Logs metric filters necessary for
compliance with the Benchmark.

[[configure_networking]]
=== Configure networking
The networking section involves a paltry four recommendations. We don't consider this section to be sufficient
to ensure a secure networking configuration. For a deeper dive, refer to Gruntwork's
link:https://gruntwork.io/guides/networking/how-to-deploy-production-grade-vpc-aws/[How to deploy a
production-grade VPC on AWS] guide, which includes recommendations for segmentation using network ACLs,
security groups, and remote access. Moreover, our link:https://gruntwork.io/reference-architecture/[Reference
Architecture] can get you up and running with a secure network configuration immediately.

If you're using Gruntwork's link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc[VPC module] for your VPCs, three
of the four recommendations in this section are already taken care of! By default, none of our modules allow
access to ports 22 or 3389 from the world, and our architecture has a least-privileges-based routing
configuration by default.

The only necessary step here is to run the link:https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke[`cloud-nuke
defaults-aws`] command to remove all default security groups from all VPCs in all regions.

[[next_steps]]
== Next steps

Congratulations! If you've made it this far, you should have achieved compliance with the CIS AWS Foundations
Benchmark. Now it's time to confirm that your configurations are correct and you didn't miss any steps. You
can enable the link:https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/[AWS Security Hub] to check your account
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards.html[for compliance with
the AWS CIS Foundations Benchmark]. The Security Hub runs the exact audit steps specified in the Benchmark
using AWS Config managed rules. By enabling the Security Hub, you can track your compliance efforts and be
notified if any recommendations have not been implemented. Follow the AWS documentation to enable Security
Hub.
