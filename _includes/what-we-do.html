    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <p>
      At Gruntwork, we've taken the thousands of hours we spent building infrastructure on AWS for
      <a href="#our-clients" class="scrolly">our clients</a> and condensed all that experience and code into a library
      of infrastructure-as-code packages that are thoroughly tested, documented, proven in production, and reusable. We
      work with your company to adapt the packages to your needs and get you set up with world-class infrastructure and
      DevOps practices in about 2 weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of our most popular packages are:

        <h3>Continuous integration</h3>
        <p>
          Automated build pipeline that runs on a CI server (e.g. Jenkins, Travis CI, Circle CI) after every commit to
          build your code, run your tests, and produce a versioned artifact of your app (e.g. Docker image or AMI built
          via Packer).

        <span class="icon major fa-rocket"></span>
        <h3>Automated deployment</h3>
        <p>
          Zero-downtime, immutable deployment triggered via a single click in your CI server, a commit to a specific
          branch, or even after every commit if you prefer continuous deployment. Includes integration with health
          checks and automatic rollback.
        </p>

        <span class="icon major fa-sitemap"></span>
        <h3>Network security</h3>
        <p>
          A secure VPC configuration with multiple environments (staging, production, mgmt), multiple layers of
          subnets (public, private, persistence), strict security groups, NAT gateways, and a bastion host for secure
          SSH access.

        <h3>Secrets management</h3>
        <p>
          Set up Vault for secrets management. Use Vault for configuration secrets (e.g. DB passwords), generating
          temporary SSH keys (instead of storing unencrypted Key Pairs), and generating temporary AWS credentials
          (instead of storing unencrypted access keys).

        <h3>Monitoring</h3>
        <p>
          Centralized log aggregation, metrics for all of your servers (e.g. CPU usage, memory usage, throughput,
          latency), and automatic alerts for a variety of problems.

        <p>
          Configure your infrastructure using Terraform; configure your apps at build time (e.g. dependencies) using
          Docker and Packer; configure your apps at runtime (e.g. service discovery) using Consul.
