    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <p>
      At Gruntwork, we've taken the thousands of hours we spent building infrastructure on AWS for
      <a href="#our-clients" class="scrolly">our clients</a> and condensed all that experience and code into a library
      of infrastructure-as-code packages that are thoroughly tested, documented, proven in production, and reusable. We
      work with your company to adapt the packages to your needs and get you set up with world-class infrastructure and
      DevOps practices in about 2 weeks.

      Some of our most popular packages are:

          <div class="clearfix">
            <i class="icon major {{ package.icon }} col"></i>
            <h3 class="col ml1">{{ package.title }}</h3>
          </div>
          <p>{{ package.description }}</p>
