        <li>
          <strong>Tested.</strong>
          Each package goes through a series of automated tests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Documented.</strong>
          Each package is thoroughly documented. We also offer DevOps training.

        <li>
          <strong>Customizable.</strong>
          We work with you to adapt each package to your needs.

        <li>
          <strong>Yours.</strong>
          The packages live in <em>your</em> codebase, so you can modify them any way you want.
        </li>
    </ul>

      Some of our most popular packages are:
