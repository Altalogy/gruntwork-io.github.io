        <h2>About Gruntwork</h2>
        <p>
          Gruntwork originally started out as two companies, Atomic Squirrel, founded by Jim, and Phoenix DevOps,
          founded by Josh. Jim and Josh met in 2015, realized they were working towards the same vision, and began working together. In 2016, after working with a number of clients and building up a library of reusable scripts, templates, and best practices, they merged the two companies together into Gruntwork.
