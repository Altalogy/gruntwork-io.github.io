- title: Apply a best-practices security baseline to each AWS account
  description: Automatically apply security baselines, defined in Terraform, to all your accounts. Whether you create the accounts using Terraform or Control Tower, this ensures that all of your accounts are properly configured with AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, AWS Config rules, Amazon GuardDuty, Macie, IAM roles, IAM Access Analyzer, VPCs, and more.

- title: Customize your AWS account baselines
  description: You get 100% of the Terraform code for the security baselines, so you can extend or customize them any way you want, ensuring that every one of your accounts meets your company’s requirements.

- title: "Control Tower Integration: the best of both worlds (Enterprise only)"
  description: |
    <p>With the Gruntwork Landing Zone Control Tower Integration, you get the best of both worlds.</p>
    <p>You get to use Control Tower to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>See all your accounts and OUs</li>
      <li>Create new accounts</li>
      <li>Ensure those accounts have CloudTrail, AWS Config, and AWS Identity Center (SSO) setup</li>
      <li>Apply controls and guard rails (SCPs, AWS Config Rules) to your accounts</li>
      <li>See which accounts and resources are non-compliant with your controls and guard rails</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And you get to use Terraform modules to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fill in security baseline features not supported by Control Tower: e.g., GuardDuty, Macie, IAM Access Analyzer, etc.</li>
      <li>Customize the baseline applied to each account by updating the Terraform modules however you want.</li>
      <li>Integrate accounts created with Control Tower with the rest of your Terraform-managed infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Stay up to date automatically using Patcher.</li>
    </ul>
