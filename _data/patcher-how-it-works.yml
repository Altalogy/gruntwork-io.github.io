  - title: Automatically discover dependencies in your code
    step-image: 1
    with-patcher: Run the Patcher CLI to automatically discover dependencies in your code, the versions they are at, and if new versions are available.
    without-patcher: You have to manually scan your code for dependencies, manually track which versions they are at, and manually look up if new versions are available.

  - title: Release new versions with patches
    step-image: 2
    with-patcher: Release a new version of your library with new features and bug fixes. If the new version is backward incompatible, create a <span id="special-span"><img class="special-span-img" src="/assets/img/patcher/rectangle-icon.png"/>patch</span> to programmatically update your users' code to fix the incompatibility. Patches can prompt users for input too!
    without-patcher: Release a new version of your library with new features and bug fixes. If the new version is backward incompatible, write up a migration guide that tells the user how to manually update their code to deal with the incompatibility.

  - title: Automatically update to new versions and apply patches
    step-image: 3
    with-patcher: Pick which dependencies to update, what version to update to, and which patches to apply. Your code is updated automatically!
    without-patcher: Update to new versions manually. If the new version is backward incompatible, go searching for a migration guide, and follow the steps to update your code manually.
