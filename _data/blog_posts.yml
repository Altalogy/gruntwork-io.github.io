    We've open sourced a tool called Terragrunt, which is a thin wrapper for Terraform that manages remote state for
    you automatically and provides locking by using Amazon DynamoDB, which should be free for most teams.

    An Infrastructure Package is a reusable, battle-tested, documented, configurable, best-practices definition of a
    piece of infrastructure. We think it’s a better way to build and manage infrastructure. And today, we’re unveiling
    the full list of Gruntwork Infrastructure Packages and releasing the documentation as open source so previous
    customers can find info from a Google search and future customers can explore our packages directly.

  excerpt: |
    Building infrastructure for a software company is much harder than it should be. There are so many moving parts and
    so many concepts to learn. How do I build my code? How do I deploy it? Should I use Docker? How do I deploy a
    Docker container? Where should I store database passwords? How do I manage SSH keys? What do I do when a server
    goes down? How can I be sure I don’t lose data? How do I even know that a server is down? It seems like there is
    never enough time to get all of these right and many companies end up scraping their infrastructure together using
    duct tape and glue.
