    A talk from HashiConf 2017  that will show you how Terraform modules work, how to design modules so they are highly
    configurable and reusable, how to write automated tests for your Terraform code, and how you can use modules to
    build your entire tech stack on top of proven, battle-tested infrastructure code—in minutes.

    This book is the fastest way to get up and running with Terraform. You'll go from deploying a basic "Hello, World"
    Terraform example all the way up to running a full tech stack (server cluster, load balancer, database) that can
    support a large amount of traffic and a large team of developers—all in the span of just a few chapters.

    This talk from HashiConf 2018 is a concise masterclass on how to write infrastructure code. I share key lessons
    from the "Infrastructure Cookbook" we developed at Gruntwork while creating and maintaining a library of over
    300,000 lines of infrastructure code that's used in production by hundreds of companies. Come and hear our war
    stories, laugh about all the mistakes we’ve made along the way, and learn what Terraform, Packer, Docker, and Go
    look like in the wild.
