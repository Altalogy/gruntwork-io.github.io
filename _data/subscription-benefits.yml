- title: Work with a team of DevOps experts
  description: |
    <p>At Gruntwork, we provide commercial support for the Infrastructure as Code Library and Reference Architecture via email, chat, and phone/video calls. As a subscriber, you get access to a team of DevOps experts for a tiny fraction of the cost of hiring a single DevOps engineer full time. We are here to help you with:</p>

- title: Get access to the Gruntwork Community Forum
  description: |
    <p>Subscribers get access to the Gruntwork Community Forum where you can talk with the other Gruntwork customers. Since you are all using the same infrastructure, this is a great place to ask questions, discuss design decisions, and work together as a community to improve infrastructure and DevOps practices.</p>

- title: Receive security alerts
  description: |
    <p>New security vulnerabilities are discovered all the time. Rarely does a month go by without at least one critical vulnerability being announced in OpenSSL, PHP, Jenkins, WordPress, or the Linux kernel. We monitor a number of security advisory lists and notify you immediately if any critical vulnerabilities are announced that may affect your infrastructure.</p>

- title: Get automated infrastructure updates<sup>(Beta)</sup>
  description: |
    <p>Everything in the DevOps world is constantly changing: AWS releases hundreds of new features a year, Terraform releases new versions every two weeks, security vulnerabilities are found daily, and we update the Infrastruture as Code Library all the time. As a Gruntwork subscriber, you can keep up to date with all of these changes—automatically—by using Patcher<sup>(beta)</sup>. Patcher is a tool that can automatically scan code in supported languages (currently, Terraform and Packer), identify updates that need to be applied, apply those updates by transforming the code, and submit a pull request for you to review.</p>
    <p class="text-muted"><em>Patcher is currently in beta and available upon request with certain limitations.</em></p>

- title: Go through a production readiness review
  description: |
    <p>The goal of a Production Readiness Review is to get your code ready for deployment to production. The Gruntwork team will work with you to review and improve your:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Overall system architecture, including scalability and high availability design</li>
        <li>Instrumentation, metrics, and monitoring</li>
        <li>Build process, manual testing, and automated testing</li>
        <li>Capacity planning, SLAs, and load testing</li>
        <li>Backups, failover, disaster recovery, and resilience testing</li>
        <li>Change management and deployment process</li>
        <li>Emergency response, runbooks, and documentation</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-muted"><em>The Production Readiness Review is currently only available with the <a href="/devops-bootcamp">DevOps Bootcamp</a>.</em></p>
- title: Receive the Monthly Newsletter
  description: |
    <p>We send out a monthly newsletter that describes all the updates we've made to the Infrastructure as Code Library as well as general news on what's happening in the AWS, Terraform, and Gruntwork ecosystem.</p>
