- title: Get full access to the Gruntwork Library.
  description: |
    <p>Subscribers get access to 100% of the code in the Gruntwork Library, a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production-ready infrastructure code. Instead of reinventing the wheel and building all your infrastructure from scratch, you can leverage the thousands of hours the Gruntwork team has spent solving common infrastructure problems, such as how to run a Docker cluster, configure a database, or set up CI/CD. The code is written in Terraform, Go, Bash, and Python, thoroughly documented and tested, and proven in production with dozens of Gruntwork customers.</p>

  description: |
    <p>As a Gruntwork Subscriber, you get access not only to all the code in the Gruntwork Library today, but also all additions, updates, and fixes we make the to the Gruntwork Library in the future, for the lifetime of your subscription. Every time we fix a bug or build a new feature for one subscriber, we make it available to all other subscribers, and you get to leverage all of this work with a simple version number bump.</p>

- title: Get automated infrastructure updates.<sup>(Beta)</sup>
  description: |
    <p>Everything in the DevOps world is constantly changing: AWS releases hundreds of new features a year, Terraform releases new versions every two weeks, security vulnerabilities are found daily, and we update the Gruntwork Library all the time. As a Gruntwork subscriber, you can keep up to date with all of these changes—automatically—by using Patcher<sup>(beta)</sup>. Patcher is a tool that can automatically scan code in supported languages (currently, Terraform and Packer), identify updates that need to be applied, apply those updates by transforming the code, and submit a pull request for you to review.</p>
    <p class="text-muted"><em>Patcher is currently in beta and available upon request with certain limitations.</em></p>
