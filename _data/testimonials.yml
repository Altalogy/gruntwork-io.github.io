  content: When I first broached the topic of working with Gruntwork and redoing our platform, there was a fair bit of trepidation and anxiety from the team. I had to sell them on the concept. Now, I'm hearing nothing but rave reviews about the work you guys have done. Literally big smiles and rave reviews. From hard-to-please-engineers. Superb work! I'll happily recommend to you all the firms where I serve on the advisory board
