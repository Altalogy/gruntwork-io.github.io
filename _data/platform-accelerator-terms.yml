This Agreement shall control over additional or different terms of any purchase order, confirmation, invoice or similar document, even if accepted in writing by both parties, and waivers and amendments to this Agreement shall be effective only if made by non-pre-printed agreements clearly understood by both parties to be an amendment or waiver to this Agreement.
