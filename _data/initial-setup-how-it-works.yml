- title: We build your architecture
  description: |
    <p>
      We translate your preferences into infrastructure code written in Terraform, Bash, Python, and Go. We put the
      code into your git repos and deploy it into your AWS or GCP account(s). For AWS, this takes about one day. For
      GCP, <a href="/static/contact/">Contact Us!</a>.

- title: Learn how to use it
  description: |
    <p>
      Use our <a href="/static/training/">DevOps Training Library</a> to learn how to use your new architecture with a series of
      micro-videos that do an in-depth walkthrough of all the most common uses cases. Need to learn Terraform, Docker,
      or Packer? We have courses on those, too!
