- title: We build your initial architecture
  description: |
    <p>We translate your preferences into a set of Terraform code built according to Terraform and <a href="http://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt">Terragrunt</a>
    best practices. All the code will live in your git repos, not ours, and we can push it to GitHub, BitBucket, or any other major source code repository provider.
    Finally, we'll apply it directly to your AWS account(s).</p>

- title: Learn how to use it

    <p>Use the included <a href="training">DevOps Training Library</a> to learn how to use your new code with a series of micro-videos that show
    all the most common uses cases in depth. Need to learn Terraform, Docker, or Packer? We have courses on those, too!</p>
