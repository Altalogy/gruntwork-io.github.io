- title: Tell us your infrastructure needs with our free online form.
  description: |
    Fill out our simple, <a href="/get-started">free online form</a> to tell us what infrastructure from the
    <a href="/gruntwork-library">Gruntwork Library</a> and <a href="/reference-architecture">Reference Architecture</a>
    you want to use: Docker or Packer? MySQL or PostgreSQL? Jenkins or CircleCI? CloudWatch or DataDog? KMS or Vault?
    Bastion host or VPN server? You choose!

- title: Schedule a free live walkthrough.
  description: |
    We’ll create the infrastructure you requested in Terraform, Go, Bash, and Python using code from the
    <a href="/gruntwork-library">Gruntwork Library</a> and our <a href="/reference-architecture">Reference Architecture</a>,
    and set up a free video call with you to walk you through the code you’d be getting. You’ll be able to see exactly
    how the code looks, how it’s documented, how it’s tested, and how it works when running in an AWS account.

- title: If you like what you see, become a Gruntwork Subscriber.
  description: |
    If the code looks like a good fit, we’ll sign you up as a Gruntwork subscriber, get your payment details, transfer
    the code into your Git repos, and deploy it into your AWS account, getting you up and running with a battle-tested,
    end-to-end infrastructure—all in about a day! If the code doesn’t fit your needs,
    <strong>you don’t pay a cent.</strong>

- title: Learn how to use your new infrastructure.
  description: |
    The infrastructure code comes with written and video documentation of how to do all common DevOps tasks: how to run
    the code in dev, how to build and test, how to deploy changes, where to find metrics, logs, and alerts, how to SSH
    to servers, and so on. If you want to go even deeper, sign up for one of the
    <a href="/training">Gruntwork Training Courses</a>, which cover topics such as Terraform, AWS, Docker, Packer,
    and Security.

- title: Keep your infrastructure up to date.
  description: |
    As a Gruntwork Subscriber, you get access to all the updates and additions we make to the Gruntwork Library, so
    better infrastructure is just a version number bump away. Moreover, if you sign up for Gruntwork
    Patcher<sup>(beta)</sup>, we will automatically update your code and submit pull requests to ensure you stay up to
    date with the latest changes from the Gruntwork Library, as well as AWS, Terraform, Docker, and other critical
    infrastructure technologies.
