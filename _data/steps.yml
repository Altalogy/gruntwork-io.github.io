- title: You need to run your infrastructure on AWS
  description: |
    You're launching a new app. You're migrating to the cloud. You're going to through a DevOps transformation. And
    this time, you're going to "do it right." But there's a problem. There are 1,001 problems to figure out: how to
    run app servers, databases, load, balancers, CDNs, continuous integration, automated deployment, monitoring, alerting, log
    aggregation, secrets management, SSH access, VPN access, DNS, TLS, and so on. And you just don't have the time or
    expertise to do it all.

- title: Try out the Infrastructure as Code library
  description: |
    Fortunately, there's a solution: the Gruntwork <a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library">Infrastructure as Code Library</a>
    (IaC Library) is a collection of reusable infrastructure code written in Terraform, Go, Bash, and Python that
    solves these 1,001 problems. Instead of reinventing the wheel, you can leverage 2+ years and 250,000+ lines of
    battle-tested code that has been proven in production at <a href="/customers">hundreds of companies</a>. To get an idea of
    how the library works, try out our <a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library#open-source">open source modules</a>
    and watch the talk
    <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/reusable-composable-battle-tested-terraform-modules-9c2fb53bc034" target="_blank">Reusable, composable, battle-tested Terraform modules</a>.

- title: If you like what you see, become a Gruntwork Subscriber
  description: |
    To get access to the IaC Library, you must be a <a href="/pricing">Gruntwork Subscriber</a>. The process is simple:
    you <a href="/contact">contact us via this simple form</a>, we'll follow up to get your payment details, and then we
    grant you access to all the code. You'll be able to use the IaC Library code directly in your own codebase via
    <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html#generic-git-repository" target="_blank">Terraform source URLs</a>
    and the <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer" target="_blank">Gruntwork Installer</a>.

- title: Deploy an end-to-end architecture in your AWS account
  description: |
    You can assemble all the code from the IaC Library yourself, or you can have the Gruntwork team assemble a
    <a href="/reference-architecture">Reference Architecture</a> for you. The Reference Architecture is an opinionated,
    battle-tested, end-to-end tech stack that includes just about everything you need, including: server cluster, load
    balancer, database, cache, network topology, monitoring, alerting, CI/CD, secrets management, VPN, and more. We
    customize the Reference Architecture to your needs, deploy it into into your AWS accounts, and give you 100% of
    the codeâ€”all in about one day.

- title: Manage everything using Gruntwork Houston
  description: |
    To manage all of your new infrastructure, you get access to <a href="/houston">Gruntwork Houston</a>. On the
    surface, Houston is a simple web interface that your Dev team can use to deploy and manage infrastructure. Under
    the hood, the web interface and how it manages infrastructure are completely defined and controlled by your Ops
    team using infrastructure as code. It's the best of both worlds: your Dev team gets an easy-to-use, self-service
    experience, while your Ops team still has all the power and control they need to ensure reliability, security, and
    compliance.

- title: Learn Terraform, Docker, Packer, AWS, and DevOps
  description: |
    Gruntwork Subscribers also get access to the <a href="/training">DevOps Training Library</a>, which
    is a collection of video courses that teach you everything you need to know to use the Iac Library and Reference
    Architecture, including Terraform, Docker, Packer, AWS, security, scalability, high availability, and more.
    If you prefer live, in-person training, we also offer an on-site <a href="/devops-bootcamp">DevOps Bootcamp</a>.

- title: Get ongoing maintenance and updates
  description: |
    At Gruntwork, we provide ongoing maintenance and updates for all the code in the IaC Libary and Reference
    Architecture. We regularly add new modules (see <a href="/custom-module-development">Custom Module Development</a>)
    and every time Terraform comes out with a new version, AWS releases new services, or a security vulnerability is
    announced, we update our code, release a new version, and announce it in our
    <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter" target="_blank">newsletter</a>. As a Subscriber,
    you get better infrastructure just by bumping a version number in your code!

- title: Get expert support
  description: |
    Gruntwork also provides commercial support for the IaC Library and Reference Architecture. Every time you have a
    question, need help troubleshooting, or want design feedback, you can reach out to us  via the
    <a href="https://community.gruntwork.io/" target="_blank">Community Forum</a>,
    <a href="mailto:support@gruntwork.io">email</a>, shared Slack channel, or phone/video calls.
