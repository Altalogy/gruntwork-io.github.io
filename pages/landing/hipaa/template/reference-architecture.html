      The Reference Architecture is an opinionated, battle-tested, best-practices way to assemble the code from the <a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library"/>Infrastructure as Code Library</a>) into an end-to-end tech stack that includes just about everything you need: server cluster, load balancer, database, cache, network topology, monitoring, alerting, CI/CD, secrets management, VPN, and more (check out the <a href="/devops-checklist/">Production Readiness Checklist</a> to see what it takes to go to prod).
