        <h4>Can I try Gruntwork Software before committing to an annual contract?</h4>
        <p>So, you just want a sneak peek? Before any contracts are signed, our team will give you a run-down of our code, training, and process. You can also try out parts of the IaC Library for free by checking out our <a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library/#open-source">open source modules</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>What's a user?</h4>
        <p>A user is any human or machine user that makes use of Gruntwork's services, including accessing code from the <a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library/">IaC Library</a> or <a href="/usage-patterns-library/">Usage Patterns Library</a>, watching videos in the <a href="/training/">DevOps Training Library</a>, or submitting requests to <a href="/support/">Dedicated Support</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h4>Is an annual subscription required?</h4>
        <p>The Gruntwork Subscription requires an annual contract (note: billing is monthly) because we give customers access to all the code in the IaC Library, and we let you keep that code even if you cancel. If we didn't have the annual contract requirement, customers could sign up for 1 day, get access to all the code, and cancel immediately. The Dedicated Support Plan doesn't have these issues, so it's a monthly contract with no annual commitment required.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>What payment options do you accept?</h4>
        <p>For monthly billing, we require automated payments via credit card or ACH transfer. If you wish to use invoices and pay by wire transfer or check instead, you must do annual billing.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>What happens if I cancel?</h4>
        <p>The Gruntwork Client License gives you perpetual rights to the code, so even if you cancel your subscription, you can keep using the code! You'll have one month to fork all the repos in the Infrastructure as Code Library into your own version control system, after which you'll no longer have access to the updates, additions, and fixes we make to the Infrastructure as Code Library, support from the Gruntwork team, security alerts, etc. However, your infrastructure will continue to work just fine and you'll still have all the code you were using up to that point, so there is no lock-in whatsoever.</p>
