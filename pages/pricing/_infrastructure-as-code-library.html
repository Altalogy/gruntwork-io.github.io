      battle-tested infrastructure code that has been proven in production at dozens of companies and is supported and
      maintained by a team of DevOps experts. With a Client License, you get access to 100% of the code

      The Client License has usage limits. One License should easily cover most small and medium deployments. If you
      exceed the limits, you must purchase another License. See the
      <a href="/faq/#what-is-the-gruntwork-client-license">FAQ</a> for details.</em></p>
