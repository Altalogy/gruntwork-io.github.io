    <h2>The most secure way to do CI / CD for infrastructure code</h2>
    <p>
      Gruntwork Pipelines is a code framework and approach that enables you
      to use your preferred CI tool to setup an end-to-end Terraform pipeline
      that allows governance, GitOps, automated Terraform tests, promotion workflows,
      approval workflows, and auditing, all built from scratch with security in mind.
      And as with most Gruntwork products, all configuration is defined as code.
