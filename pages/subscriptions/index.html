                    <p>Members receive full access to the Gruntwork Library, a collection of standalone modules maintained and supperted by Gruntwork. A module is a reusable, battle-tested solution to a common infrastructure problem, such as how to run a Docker Cluster or how to configure your Network Topology, written using a mixture of Terraform, Go, Bash, and Python.</p>

                    <p>AWS, Terraform, Docker, and all other DevOps technologies are changing all the time. Keeeping up with all of this is the core of our business, and as we keep working new clients and keep improving our practices, we capture all of that work as new modules and versioned updates to existing modules. As a member, you can leverage all of this work with a simple version of number bump.</p>

                    <h2>Get automated infrastructure updates.<sup>(Beta)</sup></h2>
                    <p>One suprising truth we learned early on is that almost no one keeps their infrastructure up to date. Worse, as your infrastructure grows, it becomes exponentially more difficult. Thatâ€™s why we created Gruntwork Patcher, a service that automatically scans your current infrastructure code, computes the delta between your current code and your desired update, and auto-generates the code updates, and auto-submits a Pull Request.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">Automated infrastructure updates are currently in beta and available upon request with certain limitations.</p>
