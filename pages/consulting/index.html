    <p>
      Whereas many consultants try to maximize their hours, at Gruntwork, the only way we can
      make our company scale is to get as much leverage out of our Infrastructure Packages as
      we can. Therefore, our incentive is to keep consulting hours to a bare minimum—usually,
      just the initial setup, customization, and training tasks necessary to get you up and
      running quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like us to develop something custom that isn’t already in our <a href="/infrastructure" class="link-bordered">Infrastructure Packages</a>, we’re happy to do it so long it solves a
      generic problem that many other companies have too, and can therefore be turned into an
      <a href="/infrastructure" class="link-bordered">Infrastructure Package</a>. For example,
      we won’t help you develop your proprietary app code, but if you need a new type of
      monitoring system, a different Docker orchestration tool, or a different way to do load
      balancing than what we already offer, we’d be happy to build it—and, of course, document
      it, test it, and support it going forward.
