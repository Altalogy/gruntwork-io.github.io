    <h2>A new standard for architecture on AWS</h2>
    <p>
      The Reference Architecture is an opinionated, battle-tested, best practices way to assemble the code from the
      <a href="/gruntwork-library">Gruntwork Library</a> into an end-to-end tech stack that has just about everything
      you need: server cluster, load balancer, database, cache, network topology, monitoring, alerting, CI/CD, secrets
      management, VPN, and more. We can deploy the Reference Architecture into your AWS account(s), give you 100% of
      the code, and do a walkthrough training, all in about a day.

      example of what the architecture looks like for a typical customer:
