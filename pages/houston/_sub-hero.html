<h2>Platform as a Service, meet Infrastructure as Code</h2>
<p>
  Gruntwork Houston gives you DevOps super powers. On the surface, it's a <strong>simple web interface</strong>
  that your Dev team can use to deploy and manage its infrastructure. Under the hood, the web interface and how it
  manages infrastructure are completely defined and controlled by your Ops team using <strong>infrastructure as
  code</strong>.

</p>
<p>
  It's the best of both worlds: your Dev team gets an easy-to-use, self-service experience, while your Ops team
  still has all the power and control they need to ensure reliability, security, and compliance.
