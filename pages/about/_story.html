    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Gruntwork originally started out as two traditional DevOps consulting companies, Atomic Squirrel, founded by Jim and Phoenix DevOps, founded by Josh. Jim and Josh met in 2015, realized that they kept re-implementing the same solution with every client, and began working together to create a better way to create best-practices infrastructure.</p>
    <p>In 2016, after working with a number of clients and building up a library of reusable scripts, temapltes, and best practices, they merged the two companies together into Gruntwork.</p>
