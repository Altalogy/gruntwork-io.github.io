    <h2>Our mission is to make understanding, developing, and deploying software 10x easier.</h2>
    <p>
      We believe that software is one of the most important technologies in human history. We also believe that, as it
      is today, software is far too dificult to use, create, understand, and maintain. We want to live in a world where
      building and maintaining software is vastly more accessible than it is today. Where the ability to create secure,
      scalable, and available software is not just the domain of a small number of elite companies.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We envision a world where software teams can quickly implement nearly all "undifferentiated heavy lifting" by using a product to tie together their tools and strategies of choice into a single cohesive platform from which they can operate their software.</li>
      <li>We envision that teams choose any tool they want â€” whether to build servers, monitoring solutions, or log aggregation services.</li>
      <li>We envision that teams can easily close their knowledge gap by using targetted educational content to provide clear, concise, real-world explanations of concepts they can immediately apply.</li>
      <li>We envision that teams can systematically benefit form a community of DevOps teams just like them who have already created scripts, techniques, and tools to solve common problems.</li>
      <li>Most of all, we envision that teams can focus inimally on common operational patterns and almost entirely on the unique aspect of their businesses.</li>
