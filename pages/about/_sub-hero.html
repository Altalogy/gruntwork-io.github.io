    <h2>Our mission is to make it 10x easier to understand, develop, and deploy software.</h2>
    <p>
      We believe that software is one of the most important technologies in human history. We also believe that, as it
      is today, software is far too dificult to use, create, understand, and maintain. We want to live in a world where
      building and maintaining software is vastly more accessible than it is today and where the ability to create
      secure, scalable, and available software is not just the domain of a small number of elite companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      We envision a world where software teams:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can build on top of the best infrastructure and tools available, rather than just those they have the time and budget for.</li>
      <li>Have access to clear training materials and real-world examples for any DevOps concept they may want to learn.</li>
      <li>Develop infrastructure, DevOps, and security practices as a large community, rather than a bunch of individual silos.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Most of all, we envision a world where software teams can spend far less time focused on infrastructure and far
      more time focused on the unique aspects of their businesses.
