                    <h2>Our mission is to make understanding, developing, and deploying software 10x easier.</h2>
                    <p>We believe that software is one of the most important technologies in human history. We also believe that, as it is today, software is far too dificult to use, create, understand, and maintain. We want to live in a world where building and maintaining software is vastly more accessible than it is today. Where the ability to create secure, scalable, and available software is not just the domain of a small number of elite companies.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We envision a world where software teams can quickly implement nearly all "undifferentiated heavy lifting" by using a product to tie together their tools and strategies of choice into a single cohesive platform from which they can operate their software.</li>
                        <li>We envision that teams choose any tool they want — whether to build servers, monitoring solutions, or log aggregation services.</li>
                        <li>We envision that teams can easily close their knowledge gap by using targetted educational content to provide clear, concise, real-world explanations of concepts they can immediately apply.</li>
                        <li>We envision that teams can systematically benefit form a community of DevOps teams just like them who have already created scripts, techniques, and tools to solve common problems.</li>
                        <li>Most of all, we envision that teams can focus inimally on common operational patterns and almost entirely on the unique aspect of their businesses.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Gruntwork originally started out as two traditional DevOps consulting companies, Atomic Squirrel, founded by Jim and Phoenix DevOps, founded by Josh. Jim and Josh met in 2015, realized that they kept re-implementing the same solution with every client, and began working together to create a better way to create best-practices infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>In 2016, after working with a number of clients and building up a library of reusable scripts, temapltes, and best practices, they merged the two companies together into Gruntwork.</p>

                    <h2>Take pride in your craft.</h2>
                    <p>You could call it “attention to detail” or even “great taste’. Or as Michael Feathers put it:</p>
                    <p>"I could list all of the qualities that I notice in clean code, but ther is one overarching quality that leads to all of them. Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious that you can do to make it better. All of those things were thought about by the code’s author, and if you try to imagine improvements, you are led back where you are, sitting in appreciation of the code someone left for you—code written by someone who cared deeply about the craft."</p>

                    <h2>Get things done.</h2>
                    <p>The counterpart to pride is craftsmanship is that we find a way to get things done. The most beautiful code that never launches or sits unfinished adds no value, no matter how beautifully it’s crafted. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. Challenging situations will come up. Don’t use the challenge as an oppurtunity to explain why you didn’t do something. Instead, ask yourself waht can possible be done and do that.</p>

                    <h2>Incrementalism.</h2>
                    <p>The best way to get things done is to deliver working code as fast as possible. We believe that quanitity of iteration trumps quality of iteration. We spend our time considering feedback on what we have actually built rather than prematurely optimizing for what we think we should build. We ruthlessly cut functionality to get v1 out the door. Then we go back and plan an incremental v2.</p>
