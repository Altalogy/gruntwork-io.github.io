      We are always ready to add the next Grunt, but as a 100% bootstrapped
      company, we only hire when our revenue supports it, so timing matters. If
      you're inspired by what you've seen and believe in a little serendipity,

    <p>
      Be an SRE without being on call! Help Gruntwork develop its internal SRE
      practices as well as offer SRE as a product to enable our hundreds of
      customers to achieve world-class operations and reliability, all while not
      being woken up at 3am!
    </p>
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Build an SRE product offering:</strong> Create a new product
        offering for Gruntwork customers that includes Production Readiness
        Reviews, training and implementation strategies for SLIs/SLOs/SLAs,
        error budgets, chaos engineering strategies, blame-free post-mortems,
        logging, monitoring, and alerting strategies around availability,
        latency, and overall systems health. This solution will be deployed both
        internally for Gruntwork and externally for our customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spend Max 50% of Your Time On Toil:</strong> We are adamant
        about having our SREs spend 50% of their time or less on

        >
        and the rest on engineering solutions to reduce it for the whole team.
        We enforce this by using a rotational schedule that ensures at least 50%
        of your time is free for engineering work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No On-Call:</strong> A key goal at Gruntwork is that no one
        should have to be woken up in the middle of the night or on New Year's
        Day due to an outage. We do not have an on-call rotation now and we’re
        building out an SRE team to help us keep it that way. How do we design
        products where outages don’t require paging someone? How do we design
        infrastructure where these outages are rare? What sorts of SLIs, SLOs,
        and SLAs should we promise customers? and the rest engineering solutions
        to reduce it for the whole team.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document tribal knowledge:</strong> Capture siloed knowledge and
        create knowledgebase articles, runbooks, and other documentation for the
        internal team as well as Gruntwork customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gruntwork systems:</strong> Own the systems and infrastructure
        that power our web presence, internal tooling, and upcoming Software as
        a Service platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>World-class customer support:</strong> While participating in
        business-hours only support rotations, triage customer requests, teach
        Gruntwork and DevOps best-practices, help resolve problems, escalate to
        internal SMEs, and automate and document the solutions so that problems

    <h2>Sales</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Sales Engineer</h3>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Senior Sales Engineer</h3>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Senior Salesperson</h3>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;">Director of Sales</h3>

    <p>We're looking for a Director of Sales who can own the sales function at Gruntwork. To date, we've asked a small number
      of DevOps engineers to handle sales calls in addition to their core work. As our company and lead volume have grown,
      our team wants to stay focused on core product development projects, leaving sales without the attention it deserves.
      Now we're looking to make our first dedicated sales hire and eventually build up a multi-member sales team at Gruntwork.
    </p>
    <p>As the Director of Sales, we'll look to you to create a sales strategy, handle all incoming leads from initial inquiry
      to signed contract, refine our pitch, measure our success, and lay the groundwork for building up a future sales team.
      You'll be supported by our current world-class engineers as they transition from "engineer sales person" to "sales engineer."
      You'll work closely with and report directly to the founders.
    </p>
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lead sales strategy at Gruntwork.</strong> Gruntwork has become a multi-million dollar company with no outside investment, no debt, and a few humble engineers leading the way on sales. How do we transition from an engineer-led sales process to a more effective one led by sales? How do we measure our success? You'll lead the charge to answer those questions and implement the strategy.</li>
      <li><strong>Design the sales pitch.</strong> Our sales presentation today involves Gruntwork engineers speaking to customer engineers with no slide deck needed. Customer love the detail and first-hand technical knowledge, but our engineers need the ability to focus on building our product. You'll help us craft an updated sales pitch for a target market (software engineers and DevOps engineers) that is averse to the classic Powerpoint and hungry for the technical details.</li>
      <li><strong>Streamline our sales workflow.</strong> We are a company of engineers so a part of us dies when we see manual data entry taking up time unnecessarily. We'll look to you to design a streamlined sales workflow that captures key data and enables key metrics using either our existing CRM (Salesforce), or to make the case for a new CRM.</li>
      <li><strong>Manage deals.</strong> We receive a growing number of leads each month and are struggling to keep up. As our first dedicated sales hire, you'll roll up your sleeves and respond to leads, lead sales calls, and close the deals. You'll engage with some of the largest enterprise companies in the world — and throughout the world — as well as cutting-edge new startups.</li>
      <li><strong>Light marketing.</strong> You'll primarily focus on converting qualified leads into signed contracts, but there may be low-hanging fruit opportunities to bring in more leads. We'll look to you to identify and coordinate those opportunities, backed by additional budget if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Grow a sales team.</strong> You'll lay the groundwork for building up a multi-person sales team. Once we can make the case that hiring another person in sales will be a positive return on investment, we'll look to you to recruit, train, and manage the growing team.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ability to sell.</strong> We can trust you to own all new opportunities ranging from small to company-changing. You should have confidence in your ability to effectively convert qualified leads to a signed contract. You should have prior experience closing deals end-to-end with both small startups and large enterprises.</li>
      <li><strong>Ability to lead and strategize.</strong> Your past results either prove you can successfully own strategy and leadership for our sales team, or this opportunity represents a natural next step in your career.</li>
      <li><strong>Moral grounding.</strong> A core principle at Gruntwork is doing the right thing. We expect all Grunts to be honest and never compromise their integrity. We understand there's a natural pressure to close the deal, but we only sell products to customers when we genuinely believe they will be of value. You should feel comfortable saying no when necessary so that we can all sleep better at night.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical skill.</strong> You should be able to build a reasonable mental model of what Gruntwork does and field a common set of customer technical questions. We'll look for indicators that you've done that before, or better yet that you have a technical background in software engineering or DevOps.</li>
      <li><strong>Bonus: Consulting skill.</strong> Gruntwork helps customers deploy production-grade cloud infrastructure in record time, and sometimes general questions come up that call upon us to become temporary consultants. Or when speaking with large enterprises, you can speak thoughtfully at the level of broad industry trends.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What time zones do we work in?</h4>
    <p>While Gruntwork <a href="/careers/#sane-working-hours">generally</a> hires anywhere between San Francisco and Berlin, candidates for this role must be within the GMT-7 to GMT-3 time zones, with a preference for being located in the USA or Canada. We expect you'll work primarily with customers and fellow Grunts in those time zones, with limited engagement with customers worldwide and Grunts in Europe. Working during reasonable hours is a priority for us.</p>
