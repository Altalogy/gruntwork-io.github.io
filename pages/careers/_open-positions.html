    <p>
      We are always ready to add the next Grunt, but as a 100% bootstrapped
      company, we only hire when our revenue supports it, so timing matters. If
      you're inspired by what you've seen and believe in a little serendipity,
      we would love to hear from you. Here are the positions we're currently
      looking for:

        Docker, Packer, etc), across many clouds (e.g., AWS, GCP, and Azure).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gruntwork Platform:</strong> build a fundamentally better DevOps
        experience. Our SaaS Platform consists of a REST API (Node.js,

        a CLI tool (Go).

        should expect to write plenty of code, but, depending on your interests,
        there will also be ample opportunity to write blog posts, give talks,
        contribute to open source, go to conferences, talk with customers, do
        sales calls, think through financial questions, interview candidates,
        mentor new hires, design products, come up with marketing ideas, discuss
        strategy, consider legal questions, and all the other tasks that are

    <ul>
      <li>You know how to write code across the stack ("Dev").</li>
      <li>You have experience running production software ("Ops").</li>

        You have a strong background in software engineering (or are working

    <h3>Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)</h3>
    <h4>
      Be an SRE without being on call! Help Gruntwork develop its internal SRE
      practices as well as offer SRE as a product to enable our hundreds of
      customers to achieve world-class operations and reliability, all while not
      being woken up at 3am!
    </h4>
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Build an SRE product offering:</strong> Create a new product
        offering for Gruntwork customers that includes Production Readiness
        Reviews, training and implementation strategies for SLIs/SLOs/SLAs,
        error budgets, chaos engineering strategies, blame-free post-mortems,
        logging, monitoring, and alerting strategies around availability,
        latency, and overall systems health. This solution will be deployed both
        internally for Gruntwork and externally for our customers.

        and the rest engineering solutions to reduce it for the whole team
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No On-Call:</strong> A key goal at Gruntwork is that no one
        should have to be woken up in the middle of the night or on New Year's
        Day due to an outage. We do not have an on-call rotation now and we’re
        building out an SRE team to help us keep it that way. How do we design
        products where outages don’t require paging someone? How do we design
        infrastructure where these outages are rare? What sorts of SLIs, SLOs,
        and SLAs should we promise customers? and the rest engineering solutions
        to reduce it for the whole team
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Document tribal knowledge:</strong> Capture siloed knowledge and
        create knowledgebase articles, runbooks, and other documentation for the
        internal team as well as Gruntwork customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gruntwork systems:</strong> Own the systems and infrastructure
        that power our web presence, internal tooling, and upcoming Software as
        a Service platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>World-class customer support:</strong> While participating in
        business-hours only support rotations, triage customer requests, teach
        Gruntwork and DevOps best-practices, help resolve problems, escalate to
        internal SMEs, and automate and document the solutions so that problems
        are mitigated for future users.
