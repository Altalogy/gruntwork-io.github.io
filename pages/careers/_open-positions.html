      company, we only hire when our revenue supports it, so timing matters. If
      you're inspired by what you've seen and believe in a little serendipity,
      we would love to hear from you. Here are the positions we're currently

    <h2>Front End Software Engineer</h2>

    <p><strong>Now seeking senior or principal levels</strong></p>

    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Gruntwork Platform:</strong> Help us build a fundamentally better DevOps experience. Our SaaS platform 
        (Node.js, TypeScript, Next.js/React, Tailwind) is the gateway to all Gruntwork products, and the tool that customers

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Docs site:</strong> DevOps is "broad and shallow" and teaching our customers both DevOps best practices
        and how to use our own products is central to our mission. To that end, we are actively working on a complete 
        re-think of how our customers experience and consume our documentation, including novel ideas on next-generation
        developer UX. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>This marketing website!</strong> See something we could improve on this website? Great, because we
        could help use your help here, too! We have a long list of improvements in mind for the structure, content, 
        UX, and messaging of this site so that we can more effectively reach both prospective customers and future Grunts.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You have a deep understanding of the core technologies we use:
        TypeScript, React, Node.js, Next.js, NextAuth
      </li>
      <li>
        You can write code across the stack, but are especially strong with front end development (HTML/CSS/React/Typescript).
      </li>
      <li>You are well-steeped in HTML and CSS and a fan of the TailWind approach.</li>
      <li>
        You write code that other developers love to read.
      </li>
      <li>
        You genuinely care about the quality of the code you work with and take initiative to improve it.
      </li>

        You're at least slightly (or moderately...) bothered when elements on a page are a few pixels off.

        Bonus: You noticed and were bothered by the fact that some sentences in this list ended in periods but others didn't.
      </li>
