    <h2>Open Positions</h2>
    <p>
      We are always ready to add the next Grunt, but as a 100% bootstrapped company, we only hire when our revenue
      supports it, so timing matters. If you're inspired by what you've seen and believe in a little serendipity,
      we would love to hear from you. Here are the positions we're currently looking for:</p>
    <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/houston">Gruntwork Houston</a>: build a fundamentally better DevOps experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library">Infrastructure as Code Library</a>: create reusable infrastructure
        modules for a variety of infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes, ELK, Consul, Vault, Kafka, MongoDB, InfluxDB,
        Jenkins, etc), using a variety of tools (e.g., Terraform, Go, Python, Bash, Docker, Packer, etc), across many
        clouds (e.g., AWS, GCP, and Azure).
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/" target="_blank">Open Source</a>: contribute to our open source
        projects, including our <a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library/#open-source">open source modules</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt" target="_blank">Terragrunt</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest" target="_blank">Terratest</a>,

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>What You'll Do</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Work on just about every aspect of the Gruntwork stack.</strong> Write Go-based CLI tools, work on
        Serverless apps in Node.js, write Terraform modules, write Python scripts and Bash scripts, do frontend
        development, learn the newest tech from AWS, GCP, and Azure, invent new ways of managing infrastructure.
        We're looking for software engineers who can go deep in any area. We're less concerned with prior experience
        than we are with curiosity about all areas of the stack and demonstrated ability to learn quickly and go deep
        when necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wear many hats.</strong> Gruntwork is a
        <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-we-built-a-distributed-self-funded-family-friendly-profitable-startup-93635feb5ace" target="_blank">small,
        distributed, self-funded, profitable startup</a>, so things are changing all the time and we all take on many
        roles. You should expect to write plenty of code, but, depending on your interests, there will also be ample
        opportunity to write blog posts, give talks, contribute to open source, go to conferences, talk with customers,
        do sales calls, think through financial questions, interview candidates, mentor new hires, design products,
        come up with marketing ideas, discuss strategy, consider legal questions, get swag for the company, and all the
        other tasks that are part of working at a small company.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You know how to write code across the stack ("Dev").</li>
      <li>You have experience running production software ("Ops").</li>
      <li>You have a strong background in software engineering (or are working hard on it!).</li>
      <li>Bonus points for a sense of humor, empathy, and curiosity.</li>
    </ul>
