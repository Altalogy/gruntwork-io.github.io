    <p>
      We are always ready to add the next Grunt, but as a 100% bootstrapped company, we only hire when our revenue
      supports it, so timing matters. If you're inspired by what you've seen and believe in a little serendipity,
      we would love to hear from you. Here are the positions we're currently looking for:</p>

    <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
    <h4>What You'll Work On</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="/houston/">Gruntwork Houston</a></strong>: build a fundamentally better DevOps experience.
        Houston consists of a serverless REST API (Node.js, TypeScript, Lambda, API Gateway), a web-based single-page
        app (Angular, TypeScript, SASS), and a CLI tool (Go).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library/">Infrastructure as Code Library</a></strong>: create reusable
        infrastructure modules for a variety of infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes, ELK, Consul, Vault, Kafka, MongoDB,
        InfluxDB, Jenkins, etc), using a variety of tools (e.g., Terraform, Go, Python, Bash, Docker, Packer, etc),
        across many clouds (e.g., AWS, GCP, and Azure).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/" target="_blank">Open Source</a></strong>: contribute to our
        open source projects, including our
        <a href="/infrastructure-as-code-library/#open-source">open source modules</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt" target="_blank">Terragrunt</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest" target="_blank">Terratest</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke" target="_blank">cloud-nuke</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/gruntwork-io/bash-commons" target="_blank">bash-commons</a>, and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>And a little bit of everything else.</strong> Gruntwork is a
        <a href="https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-we-built-a-distributed-self-funded-family-friendly-profitable-startup-93635feb5ace" target="_blank">small,
        distributed, self-funded, profitable startup</a>, so things are changing all the time, and we all wear many hats.
        You should expect to write plenty of code, but, depending on your interests, there will also be ample
        opportunity to write blog posts, give talks, contribute to open source, go to conferences, talk with customers,
        do sales calls, think through financial questions, interview candidates, mentor new hires, design products,
        come up with marketing ideas, discuss strategy, consider legal questions, and all the other tasks that are
        part of working at a small company.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Your Ideal Background</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>You know how to write code across the stack ("Dev").</li>
      <li>You have experience running production software ("Ops").</li>
      <li>You have a strong background in software engineering (or are working hard on it!).</li>
      <li>Bonus points for a sense of humor, empathy, and curiosity.</li>
      <li>
        Note that we're less concerned with prior experience than we are with curiosity about all areas of the stack
        and demonstrated ability to learn quickly and go deep when necessary.
      </li>
    </ul>
