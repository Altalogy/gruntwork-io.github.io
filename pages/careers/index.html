                    <h2>Gruntwork is a Human-Friendly Company.</h2>
                    <p>We genuinely want to build a company that is human friendly: that is, a company that is welcoming, safe, and inclusive; a company where everyone is treated fairly and with respect, a company where you get to work on interesting and important problems, but the hours are reasonable and you get plenty of time off.</p>
                    <p>To be honest, we're still learning the best way to accomplish it, but here are some of the things we do today:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We are transparent with just about everything with everyone in the company, including all financials.</li>
                        <li>We determine everyone's compensation using (non-public) formulas and we share those formulas with everyone in the company so you know that everyone is being treated exactly the same way.</li>
                        <li>We have a minimum vacation policy.</li>
                        <li>Even though we are a 100% bootstrapped startup, we not only offer equity, but also pay market salaries.</li>
                        <li>Instead of having you spend a day solving artificual coding problems on a whiteboard as an interview, if we think you could be a good fit, we'll gire you for a day (or longer, if you're available) to work on a real project, using your normal coding environment, and we'll pay you for it.</li>
                        <li>We are 100% distributed, which means you can work from anywhere in the world, your work hours are totally up to you, and a few times per year, we fly everyone out to exotic locales (recent were Dublin, Phoenix, and Austin) to work in person and have a little fun.</li>
                        <li>And finally, we believe a company must serve <em>all</em> its stakeholders, not just its customers. That means that the welfare of our team, our customers, our suppliers, and our families all matter to us.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We've taken inspiration from a number of sources and remain open-minded to continuing to improve:</p>

                    <p>We are always ready to add the next Grunt, but as a 100% bootstrapped company, we only hire when our revenue support it, so timing matters.
