    <h2>Gruntwork is a Human-Friendly Company.</h2>
    <p>We aim to build a company:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where you get to take on big challenges, but the hours are reasonable.</li>
      <li>Where everyone is treated fairly and with respect, but where disagreement is welcome.</li>
      <li>Where the team takes great pride in our craft, but also gets things done.</li>
      <li>Where we are all focused on advancing the company's mission, but get plenty of time off.</li>
      <li>That is welcoming, safe, and inclusive for people of all cultures, genders, and races.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short, <strong>we want to work on interesting problems, with interesting people, while leading interesting lives.</strong></p>
    <h3>How We Work</h3>
    <p>We're still learning the best way to run a company, but here are some of the things we do today:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We are transparent with just about everything within the company, including all sharing all financial details.</li>
      <li>We determine everyone's compensation using (non-public) formulas and we share those formulas with everyone in the company so you know that everyone is being treated exactly the same way. <a id="ref-1" href="#">[1]</a> <a id="ref-2" href="#">[2]</a></li>
      <li>We have a minimum vacation policy. <a id="ref-3" href="#">[3]</a></li>
      <li>We offer not only equity, but also pay above-market salaries, and offer a generous benefits package that includes 100% paid dental coverage, 100% paid vision coverage, and significant cost sharing on health coverage. <a id="ref-4" href="#">[4]</a> <a id="ref-5" href="#">[5]</a></li>
      <li>We have grown our company without any outside investment, giving us the freedom to pursue our mission while holding true to our values.</li>
      <li>We are 100% distributed, which means you can work from anywhere in the world, your work hours are totally up to you, and a few times per year, we fly everyone out to exotic locales (recent trips included Dublin, Phoenix, and Austin) to work in person and have a little fun.</li>
      <li>If we think you could be a good fit, we'll hire you for a day (or longer, if you're available) to work on a real project, using your normal coding environment, and we'll pay you for it. This way, even in the intervewing phase, we get to work together right away.</li>
      <li>And finally, we believe a company must serve <em>all</em> its stakeholders, not just its customers or shareholders. That means that the welfare of our team, our customers, our suppliers, and our families all matter to us.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We've taken inspiration from a number of sources and remain open-minded to continuing to improve:</p>
