    <h2>Gruntwork is a Human-Friendly Company.</h2>
    <p>We aim to build a company:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where you get to take on big challenges, but the hours are reasonable.</li>
      <li>Where everyone is treated fairly and with respect, but where disagreement is welcome.</li>
      <li>Where the team takes great pride in our craft, but also gets things done.</li>
      <li>Where we are all focused on advancing the company's mission, but get plenty of time off.</li>
      <li>That is welcoming, safe, and inclusive for people of all cultures, genders, and races.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short, <strong>we want to work on interesting problems, with interesting people, while leading interesting lives.</strong></p>
