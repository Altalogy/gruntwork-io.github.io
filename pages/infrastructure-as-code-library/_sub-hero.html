      Most teams have the same basic infrastructure needs: server cluster, load balancer, database, cache, CI/CD,
      monitoring, secrets management, and so on. Why waste time building it all from scratch? At Gruntwork, we are a
      team of DevOps experts who have spent thousands of hours writing reusable infrastructure code, and now you can
      leverage all of it with the Infrastructure as Code Library.
