    <h2>A Terraform-native approach to AWS Landing Zone</h2>
    <p>
      A "LandingZone" is a tool for quickly creating new AWS accounts,
      configuring those accounts with a best-practices security baseline,
      and configuring a multi-account setup. Gruntwork Landing Zone is built to achieve these goals
      specifically for Terraform users.
