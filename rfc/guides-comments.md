Options available for adding comments to the deployment guides are as follows:

1.  Disqus: <https://disqus.com/>

Really good third party service and the most popular. It has 3 options:

-   Basic: This has ad's (not recommended)

-   Plus $9 per month (Suitable for under 50k visitors daily)

-   Pro $89 per month (Suitable for 150k visitors daily)

Pros:

-   It provides a dashboard to manage for all the comments posted.

-   Analytics available for comments on the dashboard.

-   Very easy to install

Cons

-   Being a third party service, we don't know what our comments become and how disqus uses the data retrieved from the comments 

-   Disqus doesn't have a great track record on privacy

-   We cannot control the look and feel of the design

-   Does not allow anonymous content

1.  Just comments  [https://just-comments.com/](https://just-comments.com/pricing.html)

Also a third party service and very similar to Disqus

Pros:

-   Look and feel of the design is customizable

-   Pay as you go but you will need to pay 5.30 dollars for having an active api key per month

Cons

-   We have no control over the data

1.  Commento  <https://commento.io/>

Pros

-   The data retrieved is ours

-   Pay what we want <https://commento.io/pricing>

Cons

-   We have to host the solution

1.  Staticman:  <https://staticman.net/>

Pros:

-   Designed to work with jekyll

-   Complete control over the data/content, user experience, and user interface.

-   Not just for comments! Perfect for any sort of user generated content: reviews, comments, polls, and more.

-   Allows comments to be posted without any login required.

Cons:

-   Not sure if it is a downside but Staticman access to your Jekyll repository
